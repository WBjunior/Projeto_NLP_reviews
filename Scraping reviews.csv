0,"OK, I fouled up with my Kindle Paperwhite 11th edition purchase. It was Prime Day and the Kindle was marked WAY DOWN, and I opted for the bundle: Kindle + Charger + fabric cover. Now don't get me wrong, the Charger is nice and the fabric cover is very nice, but for a device Amazon says you only need to charge 5 times a year, getting a premium charger doesn't really make much sense. I already have plenty of chargers, and the Kindle will charge overnight whether I use their super-fast premium charger or something else. And while the case is undeniably nice, you can get one for less than half the money from other sellers on Amazon.

I did not make the mistake of getting the ad-free version. The ad appears on the lock screen and as soon as you swipe the screen, it goes away and stays away for your entire reading session. It's 100% unobtrusive. Other people have given the Kindle one star because they bought the ad-free version, and were angry there are still ""suggestions"" on the Home screen that they consider ads. All I can say is that you get that no matter what, and the solution is to switch to the Library screen rather than the Home screen; that's very easy on the latest software version.

The other huge mistake I made over 4 years ago was subscribing to Kindle Unlimited and somehow not knowing that it was automatically renewing silently every month (for $9.99). I paid enough to buy several Kindles. I guess I thought it was part of Amazon Prime or just something that comes with a Kindle. You can bundle Kindle Unlimited ""Free"" for 3 months with your Kindle purchase, but just watch out when that 3 months are over. I have generally found Kindle Unlimited books second rate (with a few exceptions).

I bought one of the original Kindle Fire versions and the first Kindle Fire HD. They were cool, but I didn't end up using them much. They didn't have good battery life, they were hard to read outdoors, and Kindle software on other portable devices was fine. I think the first one eventually failed, and I gave the HD away to someone who needed to do something that required a Kindle. I have a nice Windows tablet.

But I have always wanted a Paperwhite because of its long battery life and superb readability outdoors. Plus it was heavily discounted on Prime Day and I bought one.

So how did it live up to expectations? Pretty well. The ""10 weeks"" battery life claim seems exaggerated, but still if you pick it up to go somewhere, it will probably be charged and last another day. Outdoor readability is simply amazing.

After receiving the device, the software updated. I think it updated twice. My ""Experimental Web Browser"" turned into the ""Web Browser"" and the navigation improved markedly (addressing issues I read in other 1-star reviews). The web browser is still very limited and doesn't display some web pages correctly (like the Internet Archive), and error messages still mention the ""Experimental"" browser. You can't access YouTube, for example, Twitter doesn't seem to work at all, and the New York Times is not readable.

On books, three-level table of contents don't work on the Kindle, although they work on Kindle for PC.

I had a very good experience emailing a PDF document downloaded from our local Planning Commission to the Kindle. Things you send to the Kindle arrive very fast. Amazon did, however, require me to verify myself as a sender before it would deliver email attachments to the Kindle, even though my email address is on the approved senders list at Amazon. Also plugging the Kindle to a PC lets you drag and drop supported document types (notably MOBI and PDF) to the Kindle where the immediately appear in your Library. The Send to Kindle for PC app is currently broken as reported by me and others on Amazon forums.

The device is somewhat sluggish in general with a 1-second delay for most things: swipes, scrolls and navigation. That's certainly not something that would interfere with reading a book. There are so many different ways to navigate, that it can appear jumbled and confusing, plus the software updates I got changed everything, making me re-learn the UI. I think in the end that I will be accustomed to it and it will appear more natural.

One severe limitation is that you cannot play audio files in general. While it supports Bluetooth headphones for books from Audible, it cannot play music or audio books in general. (I hope this is enhanced in a future software update.)

So should you buy one of these? If you want to sit outdoors under a tree or at the beach for hours on end reading a book, a Kindle Paperwhite makes a lot of sense. The reading experience is good, it's visually sharp and the charge lasts a long time. If you want to listen to music, or do much of anything else you can do on a phone or a tablet computer, you're out of luck.",4.0
1,"The first thing I thought of when I saw an e-reader was AWESOME! But that was before they introduced the paperwhite models. In essence, they were amazon branded android tablets. They were slow and clunky and incredibly cheap. I'm further embarrassed to admit my first e-reader was actually a Barnes & Noble Nook. Which - if anything - was worse than the original Kindle's.

I also discovered that I just plain missed holding a book. I couldn't explain it but I know a lot of people understand what I'm talking about. There is just something about being able to physically hold that book in my hands that just felt ""right"" and the e-readers just did not provide that.

Finally amazon introduced the paperwhite and that was an absolute game changer. The ability to read a Kindle in direct sunlight was just unheard of. The older color versions were essentially useless in direct sun, or even marginally cloudy days as well. I still preferred holding a book in my hands though. But that all changed one night when I couldn't sleep and I tried to read at 1am and couldn't get ANY light to work well enough while also trying to hold my hard back book and not wake up my wife. It became a challenge of monumental proportions (at least for me it was). Slowly, over the course of the next 6 months, I began to warm up to the idea of giving the Kindle another try.

This is where I made a big mistake however. Instead of buying it new, I went with a reputable company that sold reconditioned electronics for a deep discount. My reasoning seemed solid (at the time), if I ended up not truly enjoying my Kindle, at least I hadn't wasted too much $$ on buying a new one. Unfortunately, the model I received was tied to the account of the former owner, and I wasn't able to correct that with a simple master reset. It took several days to work thru that problem, but once I did, I was off and running. I got a slightly smaller model (6"" screen) and while it functioned, it stuttered so often I forgot just how smooth it really should've been. But still, even with the issues, the hiccups and stuttering, I grew to really enjoy using it and more importantly, I loved the battery life it offered.

I decided it was time for an upgrade, and this time I was going all-in. I got the 6.8"" screen, which isn't that much bigger, but it DOES make a difference. Since I ordered directly from amazon this time, imagine my absolute surprise when I turned it on I was worried that it was going to take forever to link up to my WiFi and have to add my amazon account information...but that did not happen. Not sure if amazon pre-programmed it, but as soon as I turned it on it said, ""Welcome Jeff"" and I was stunned. How did it know??? Well, no matter, the set-up was a friggin' breeze and I was thrilled how seamless it was.

Operation was so much easier and while it still offers a little stuttering (which in all honesty is simply due to the black & white screen and how it operates) but it was decidedly better than the older model. Battery life is stellar, though not as good as amazon claims. I think what they say is almost absurdly optimistic. But, the truth is, a paperwhite will give you pretty great life on a full charge.

It operates well, and I love how I can invert the screen so more of it is black. Not sure if that uses less battery like it does on an amoled phone screen, but I'm going to see and test it just in case. My old Kindle did not have this option.

All in all, reading is fun again for me and I love how I don't need a special light to read in the middle of the night like I did with a hard back. Kudos to amazon, I love my Kindle.",4.0
2,"I don't like upgrades. Every time I'm forced to get some new piece of electronic equipment, I dread the experience. I still haven't switched to Windows 11, even. Tried it once, couldn't delete it fast enough!

You have to understand, I've only had one Kindle, and it's about 12 years old. I took good care of it, and had to replace the battery once, but it still worked. Sort of. But turning pages took longer and longer. Often, it took so long, poor Kindle would just send an error message and give up. I wasn't even able to open some of the newer books. The replacement battery was losing its ability to hold a charge. Even worse, my Kindle case was literally falling apart, but my Kindle was so old, I couldn't find a replacement.

So when I could postpone the inevitable no longer, I ordered the 11th Generation Paperwhite.

When it came time to actually make the purchase, my palms sweated madly, but discovering the 16G was on sale—making it cheaper than the 8G I'd decided was more financially affordable—cheered me right up. Getting a trade-in that equaled one payment, and receiving a gift card that pretty much covered the cost of a new case, made it even better.

The new Kindle arrived on time, and I was actually excited to try it out. There was just enough power in the battery to set it up before it needed charging. I'm quadriplegic, so the touch screen was a welcome change. I worried I'd be constantly swiping and wearing out my arm, but a tap is enough to turn pages. I like the lighted backscreen, which I didn't have before, and the wider size is easier for me to hold.

Someone complained about the edge being too narrow to hold on to, but that's what the cases are for. I wouldn't recommend trying to use this product without a case to cover it. Not only does it protect the Kindle, but it makes it much easier to hold. I really love the way this Kindle sleeps when I close the cover, and wakes when I open it.

I'm clumsy from nerve damage, so I sometimes touch the screen by accident, causing it to skip pages. But this device is so fast, I find my place again without difficulties. That was one of the things I worried about, before the purchase, but it's not a problem.

What I don't like: the clock down in the bottom left corner. I turned it off, and when I briefly looked at another book, it turned back on again. When I turn something off, I want it to STAY OFF. And if I don't like it for one book, then I don't want it on any books—but you have to turn off each book separately. And apparently, if you leave the book for any reason, then you have to turn it back off, AGAIN. When you've got issues with hands/arms, any extra click is too much.

Let me turn it off in the device for ALL books, please, not just one book at a time.

The other thing I hate is the way collections are managed. Before, when I added a book to a collection, that title was taken off the list. Now it stays on the list, so I have to scroll through EVERY book on the list, EVERY TIME. Since many book titles are similar—especially books in the same genres—that gets very confusing, very quickly. Not to mention, it's time consuming. Especially if you own over 1000 books!

Just let me add a book to a collection, then take it off the complete list. Maybe you think I want to put it in multiple collections, Amazon, but I'd trade that option for ease and simplicity of use, any day.

Also, I can't seem to get the highlight function to work. When I try, all I can get it to do is make a note. I've gone through the Kindle guide several times, and I've also searched online for an answer, but I can't find anything to explain why it won't give me a way to save a highlight. I often highlight passages to read to my sister; I don't want to make notes about them, just read them to her!

Overall, I'm very pleased with this product. There are just a few, small annoyances that I'm apparently going to have to live with, I guess. I'd really, really like it if—just once—a new product kept all the good features and only 'improved' the bad ones. It's all about choice. Most of my unhappiness stems from the loss of a choice that I considered crucial.

If Amazon had just left those easy little things unchanged, and given me the choice to do things the way I had become accustomed to doing, this would be a perfect product.",4.0
3,"PROS: Well, I REALLY like the 11th Gen over my 7th Gen. I'll do it in 4 points:
1-Larger Screen.. Nice
2-Color Temp adjustment for the screen. My background is photography so to me the new screen goes from say 8000 degrees Kelvin to about 2500 degrees Kelvin. I'm happy around 4700-5000
3-LONGER battery life.. like 2 months vs 3 weeks
4- USB-C!! YES! (my old microUSB was always getting wobbly.

I did not mention the increase from ""4""GB to ""8""GB..because ..well. in the 7th Gen the 4GB is actually 3.1GB with the rest taken up by the OS on the new one.. it's actually...wait for it.. 6.25GB! Yep the OS went from .9GB to 1.75GB! A bit piggy for me. I made a joke with a few of the Kindle Tech people that they got ideas from Windows Vista!. Most got the joke.

CONS: Now onto issues..several which are really for how I use my Kindle:
1- ok the not quite 8GB issue. Hey I understand the increase in size..but how about making Audible a CHOICE.. you can add it or make it optional. If you take away Bluetooth support and Audible..maybe we might gain some space back. (Personally I use nice plug-in headphones. I really only see Audible BT when on a long drive in the car..like music. But then again, you can just put it in a format like MP3 and play it thru the car. I have the entire Hitchhiker's Guide Radio Broadcasts like that)
2- BIG (to me ) BUG the issue? as in the photograph.. I use Amazon Cloud Collections. I organize my ebooks (most I got before I got the kindles) using Calibre. So when I set up series, I use the Series name, or I use the Author, or Subject as a title for the Collections. sometimes, (as in the case of the Dune series), books are added that happened in-between earlier books that came out. So when that happens I will add the book. And when you have a series of say 11 books, 9 of which came out years ago, I'll add the book as the following:
01-Dune
02-Dune Messiah
03-Children of Dune
then 3 books were added.. Tales of Dune. Paul of Dune, and The Winds of Dune.
In my older 7th Gen PW it showed like this:
00-Tales of Dune
01-Dune
01.5-Paul of Dune
02-Dune Messiah
02.5-the Winds of Dune
03-Children of Dune
BUT, As the photograph shows, the new 11th Gen PaperWhite has a bug!
00-Tales of Dune
01.5-Paul of Dune
01-Dune
02.5-the Winds of Dune
02-Dune Messiah
03-Children of Dune
This should REALLY be addressed!
3-This is not so much a Kindle PW issue, as so much it's an Amazon issue. and it deals with the Amazon Cloud Collections. As I use Calibre, and I have a LOT of books that were originally Epubs, I used Calibre to convert them and organize them into series. And after various different methods, including sideloading from the computer, I decided to use the Cloud Collections. So I sent ALL of my converted epubs (now mobi files) to Amazon and used the website to organize them into the collections. Which went very well ....at first.
First..about 2-3 years ago, Amazon removed the ability to send the Collection to Device. So now I HAVE to use the actual PW to get my Collections onto my Kindle. Recently, Amazon changed the display format on the pages on how they show books and doc files. And if you want to add a book or doc to a collection, it's now incredibly tedious! Formally when you did a box would open that would let you start typing the name of the collection, or make a new collection. All in one box. NOW, a box open which shows 2 or 3 collections.. not in any order other than Recent..with a check box! You can't find the collection by typing the title.. you can only scroll..and it only shows 2 collections at a time. That's fine if you have 6 collections.. but I have 49 page of 5 COLLECTIONS EACH!!! PLEASE PLEASE PUT BACK THE OLD WAY OR ADD A SEARCH OPTION!! You've actually found a way that is so much more tedious than the actual Paperwhite!!!!! you can't even make a new one on there.. you have to go back to the collection Tab.. THEN go back to the doc or book tab and start all over! Please go back to the old way !!!
4- the new Library Series option. It only works for purchased books, not docs. also, I had to call up because it grouped two books together, in a series..(nice), but then stuck on e of the GRAYED OUT, above the first collection.. only in Download. I found out I had to do a Reboot after turning Library option off. (I ended up putting the two books in a collection.. like I like.

Well that's about it. btw I ALWAYS use the LIST vs GRID option.. and using HOME is no longer a nice choice. I prefer when HOME was the same as LIBRARY .. in my case..the first collection, and all the collections after which comes the books in Recent order
now... waiting for a dark brown cork case.
______________________________________
Slight update or comment on the software version. My wife and I both upgraded to the 11th Gen. Her's came with her case..Amazon Black Leather, while I wait for the cork. Her 11th gen came with 5.14.1 1, while mine came with 5.14.0 . I was a bit surprised since both were ordered at the same time. And arrived together. But, not a big issue, since eventually all units will be on the latest software. So? What to do? I've read a LOT on here about complaints it's so hard, I know.
Since my ""update"" was grayed out, I just downloaded the latest version and put it on my 11th gen, and rebooted..and BINGO! No problem, I now have the latest software.

Now fix the real BUG I addressed and fix the ""Manage Your Content"" pages regarding using Cloud Collections. Oh, while you're at it, fix the damn Amazon Android App so I can work with Cloud Collections via the App. And not just my tower. Thanks",4.0
4,"Kindle Signature Paperwhite plus Charging Stand

I own the 11th Gen (newest model 2022) standard Kindle Paperwhite and the Signature Paperwhite. I love them both. If dough is not the issue, I would buy the Signature model for fifty bucks more. Here’s some of my particular findings in use.

Cases: Note that I do not like the Amazon cases because I don’t like folding over cover type cases; I prefer cases that simply help with holding the device. I purchased the “MoKo Case for 6.8"" Kindle Paperwhite (11th Generation-2021) and Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition, Ultra Clear Soft Flexible Transparent TPU Skin Bumper Back Cover Shell, Clear” from Amazon and it fits the Kindle ideally, and most importantly this case DOES go on the proprietary charging stand made by Anker and the charge does go through the case (that is, I do not need to remove the case to charge the Kindle in that charging stand).

Battery: Amazon states that the Kindle 11th gen will hold a charge for 10 weeks, when used at limited brightness for 90 minutes a day (and a lot of other stipulations, like WiFi and Bluetooth off, etc). In reality, many may turn up the brightness, read more than 90 minutes, and Airplane mode on, or use other features that drain the battery faster (See audiobooks below). I have found that my battery drains faster than 10 weeks, but I am using the device with Airplane mode off, Wifi on, Bluetooth On. I do not like turning off wifi in particular because it MUST Be on to sync books between devices, and since I have two Kindle 11th gens, plus a MacBook, iPhone, iPad, and I read 5 books at a time simultaneously, I have no desire to turn wi-fi off. Thus, having Qi charging is helpful…not mandatory but helpful. Another BIG reason for the Qi charging is Audible audiobooks. I do listen to them through the Kindle itself, and the battery drains fairly quickly when listening to audiobooks.

Memory Storage: The Kindle has 8 GB storage, but only 5.8 GB after their software OS. The Signature Kindle has 32 GB storage, but only 28 GB after their software OS (there is slightly different software between the two models as the Signature supports more menu and charging features). So if you love downloaded “off-line” reading, and in particular if you enjoy having audiobooks in your downloaded library (they take much more storage than an e-book), the 32 GB is reassuring.

Auto-light adjust: I can’t even detect that it’s doing anything, but if one rides a train daily to work and it passes through dark tunnels, this feature may be of benefit to you.

Advertising free: Many forget the $20 value of the ad-free that is part of the Kindle Signature. Even those that wouldn’t pony up for it on their own may enjoy it here as “icing on the cake” for the price difference. I like seeing my own book cover on the sleep screen, and that is not possible with the “with ads” version. I thought I enjoyed the ads for editors choice books and book sales and stuff, but I much prefer the ad-free model. And, little discussed fact, the ad-free version has one less swipe to get to your Library or current book every single time you turn on the Kindle. True!

Dedicated Signature Charger Stand: I bought the Qi charging stand and like it greatly. It does work with my “MoKo Case for 6.8"" Kindle Paperwhite (11th Generation-2021) and the Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition, Ultra Clear Soft Flexible Transparent TPU Skin Bumper Back Cover Shell, Clear”., and charges through the case and the case fits the stand (but not quite as bump-proof as the Kindle without the case). I like that the stand sits quietly on my desk as I am working, or on my coffee table while I’m watching sports do I can read during commercials. I do not need to keep the AC cord attached to the stand at all times; sometimes I use the charger stand as simply a free-standing stand for either of my Kindles. I like that it can hold my Kindle 11th generation normal edition without Qi charging and I can read on it as an easel stand. I feel the utility as an easel stand is underrated. Qi chargers in general are not free, and neither are easel stands, so coupling those two together, you get the price of this Anker model. I find no issues with the size of the “wall wart” or the plug in the back of the stand. Some people complain with the charging stand that the white light indicator does not turn to another color, such as green, to indicate full charge. A “work around” for this is to place the charging Kindle on the stand upside down; now the LED light at the bottom of the Kindle device itself, which does change color when fully charged, is face upward and easily seen. Frankly, there is no issue with simply assuming the Signature PW is charged after an hour or two. I like this stand much more than I thought I would.

I’ve owned every Kindle since the first one! I use library Libby, and am an Audible and Kindle Unlimited subscribers. I guess you could say I’m a “power user”. I definitely prefer the Signature version, but both are good readers. If I could change one thing about these Kindles, it would be to add a physical button like the Oasis. I realize that sounds outdated, but to reach and switch with the other hand, or reach thumb across screen to scrub, every page turn is a chore that is solved with an under-thumb button like Oasis. Additionally, the e-ink is good, but after two decades, one would think the text versus background contrast would be better…that is, darker text, whiter background. Instead, it remains darkest gray text in lightest gray background, not ideal. Happy reading!",4.0
5,"I’ve really gotten into books lately. I read everyday. I decided to try out the kindle because buying physical copies was getting a bit expensive and it was taking up too much shelf space (I’ll only be buying copies of books that I love now). And I just wanted something portable to take with me everywhere. When I go on vacation, books take up too much room.
I do have a tablet but it’s just harder on the eyes and way too big compared to this kindle as you can see in the photo. The size difference. I much prefer the smaller screen. I can hold it easier when I’m laying in bed.
A couple things I’ve noticed that aren’t too great is the fact it freezes a lot. I have to restart it somewhat frequently. It does lag but that doesn’t bother me. And the other thing is the white dot you see on the fourth picture under the last word. I did notice a lot of people complained about the “dead pixels” that are frequent on these things. So I decided that this pixel wasn’t worth returning for. It could be worse honestly.
But other than that it’s perfect. It’s got the warm light so it doesn’t strain your eyes and you can adjust the font and the size of the font if you can’t read smaller letters. Which I love.
Overall really happy with my purchase. I’m sad I didn’t get one of these sooner",4.0
6,"I got this last year as an upgrade to my Kindle Paperwhite 3. After having used it for a year, I think I have settled on most of my opinions. So, here's the breakdown:

Pros:
++ The screen is larger
+ The resolution is sharper
++ The warm light option is excellent, and one of its biggest selling points
+ The internal software for calculating my reading speed is more accurate and more reliable. It often glitched out on my Paperwhite 3 and got stuck believing that I read at god-level speeds. Nothing like this has ever happened on my Paperwhite 5, although it still seems to generally underestimate how long it'll take me to finish a chapter.
+ USB-C connection rather than micro-USB: this makes for delghtfully fast charging.
+ It can store audiobooks and has bluetooth capabilities. However, I have yet to take an interest in either of these functions.

Cons:
- It's actually a little bit LESS responsive than my Paperwhite 3.
- The bezel is flush with the screen, which I suppose makes it waterproof, but it also makes the device harder to grip.
- The bezel is too narrow for my tastes, since it again makes the device harder to grip without touching the screen. Though, this issue can be mitigated by increasing the margin size. The Kindle doesn't do anything with touch inputs that are sufficiently long and don't touch any words, so you can safely rest your thumb on the margins while you're reading.
-- It takes significantly longer to wake up than my Paperwhite 3. Part of that is because my Paperwhite 5 has ads on the lock screen, meaning I have to always swipe to unlock, which I don't have to do with my Paperwhite 3. But even with this under consideration, when it's my first time turning the device on after a while, it usually takes around 1-3 seconds to prompt me to swipe to unlock, and another 1-2 seconds for it to actually load up my reading spot again. It's especially bad when the Kindle is cool, e.g. under 60 degrees. But my Paperwhite 3 was also a lot slower in cold air too, so this isn't too big of a gripe.
-- I'm pretty sure the screen bleeding is worse in this model than for the Paperwhite 3. Stray artifacts will sometimes stick around even after the screen refreshes, leaving traces of the previous screen state lingering on the device. I've attached a photo to show you what I'm talking about. In it, my Kindle is set to sleep mode, but you can see the words in the current book that I'm reading. The Paperwhite 3 does this a bit too, but nowhere near as badly, and the screen refreshes are always successful. This is a somewhat minor inconvenience, but it is a distraction sometimes.

Overall, I'm not entirely sure if I can even call this an upgrade to the Paperwhite 3. It has a lot of extra features that I love, and I guess at the end of the day, it's this model that I'm reading now and not my old Paperwhite 3. But when I look back at my old Paperwhite 3, and consider the fact that it still works perfectly fine, I can't help but feel like I really didn't need this upgrade.

So, if you're looking to pick up a new Kindle Paperwhite ... yeah, get the NEW Kindle Paperwhite. The USB C charger, the larger screen, and the warm light are all major conveniences that make using the device a lot more enjoyable. But if you are in the position I was in back in 2022, and you want to upgrade the Paperwhite that you already have, then save yourself the money and skip this. You're not getting that much more, and you'll probably be trading off some features that you like in the process.",4.0
7,"This is kindle 5 for me, started with gen 1 gen 7 just wore out, I had replaced the battery twice and counted on a trade to drop the price. Works about the same but the screen is just not right, I have the new to me warmth setting off and the screen still appears dark. I can use the light to make it as bright as the old paperwhite, but there goes battery life. Other than that the only problem is the library screen clearly designed by someone who 1) rarely reads books 2) chooses them by their cover. I purchased my first kindle due to astigmatism and poor near vision, hated using my readers, still do. Then came e ink and adjustible font sizes ! Which you Had on older versions of library, Not now. No matter how much I squint, adjust settings etc I just cannot see the author, title or other cogent info. I read 7 books a week, I want to see when they were checked out, when due, author title and if read and how much. And not resort to my 3.25 readers. Of course you can tell the non reader engineers got in their licks too. "" lasts xxx days !"" And in brackets "" reading 30 minutes a day"" . Well I read about 360 minutes a day. As do many of us who beleive TV and social media have dumbed up society. As an Engineer (E.E.) I am well aware that a battery hatch and swapable Li cells could be used to extend the life of these devices. Right now I am looking at my wifes underwater camera good to 60 feet that uses a $12 li 0.4 mm thick that takes seconds to swap out of it's waterproof compartment. Would I pay more for this - you bet. About that library screen - a little coding magic and you could adjust the size. So overall from a readers standpoint NO advance over earlier versions. That dark screen is advertised as looking more booklike. Yeah if you like reading old foxxed paperbacks under a bedspread at night with a flaslight.",4.0
8,"First, I spend a huge bundle of coin buying ebooks! Been a ""massive reader"" since I, well, could read (didn't have Amazon ALL of those years ago). Now, I'm older than dirt, and disabled, just a bit! Anyway, I fell for Dear Sir Jeff and his enterprise years ago, still have my very first ""Kindle"" that speaks not a word! Anyway, wow! Fell head over heels for my first Paperwhite.......such class! Someone at Amazon once told me that ""wow, lady, you have maybe 4000 ebooks!"" to which I replied ""then I had better get to shopping!""
So, onward to recent times. Struggled about buying new PaperWhite, didn't bother reading reviews, jumped in. I had spent hours, months, years creating Collections......wow, how very wow was that idea brilliant?!! And in the Good?OldDays, when you bought new, seemed that your life just flopped over, didn't it? At least with dear Amazon. Anyway, none of that boring tech stuff, onward with impressions:
1) I splurged, got the LEATHER cover, in brown of course! Expensive perhaps, but oh, my!! Beautiful! And I'm worth it!
2) Screen seems, well, somewhat fabulous. Print seems very proud of itself, kind of showy (like me in younger days in a new, hot dress?!).
3) Collections seem to be all present, along with their ebooks. Kinda too early to tell, cross your fingers! However, they clearly have not learned our alphabetic or numeric systems, entirely!
So, beloved gals and guys, all seems fine, so far. Change is always a struggle......look up definitions to ""new,"" ""old,"" ""remodeled,"" ""unchanged,"" anyway, you get my message, I hope? Cling to your love of reading, just in case you become old, like me! AND.......

9,"I always said I would never buy a Kindle because I just like the feel of a regular book and turning pages but they were on sale so I figured why not try it? I love it! It’s such a nice small size and you can make all the necessary adjustments you need on it to fit your needs. This will be great to read really long series on that have say 6 books to a series, instead of buying them all I can read on Kindle. It was easy setup, synced to my Goodreads and Libby apps as well, and will most likely be buying the Kindle Unlimited subscription soon. You can borrow free library books on it though. One thing that does annoy me is the ads, but they can be removed by contacting customer service apparently which I will try to navigate at some point!",4.0
10,"I’ve been getting into reading more the past month or so. Between getting ebooks thru Libby from the library to physical books, I’ve found that I’m enjoying reading books off the kindle app on my iPhone so much for its convenience and much lighter than a physical book. So I held out on buying a kindle thinking “well I have the app”

Then I found myself having to charge my phone more regularly at work between working on my phone and reading when I have a few minutes. And I didn’t quite like that.

So I caved and got the kindle paperwhite on sale for $99 using an Amazon gift card I got for Christmas thinking, I’ll try it for 30 days and see how I like it.

Welllllll three days later I’m already strolling thru TikTok kindle refreshing deciding how I wanna decorate my kindle.",5.0
11,"This is the best purchase I've made in a while. I decided to buy myself this as a birthday present to start reading books. Adding Kindle Unlimited gives me thousands of options to read for free. The fact this puts no strain on my eyes and is so lightweight make it perfect for reading books for hours and not even realize the time that's gone by. The screen really does look like you're reading a real book. I got myself a Kindle Fire HD 10 for everything else such as Comic Books, Movies/Shows, Picture books, etc.. but for just reading books with only texts you simply can't beat this Kindle Paperweight. I almost went with the 6"" but the cost is so close with the 6.8"" that I decided to go slightly bigger and I'm happy I did.",5.0
12,"I have two of these, one to keep at work and one to keep at home. So far, I like the bigger screen size compared to the last model from 2018 (Paperwhite 4 gen 10). I did like the last model’s weight a little better, but the slightly heavier weight is not a deal breaker in order to have a larger easier to read screen. Also an improvement over the previous one that I had is the page turning responsiveness. Almost instant with a touch when the other one was often clunky in its responsiveness to touch.

The night light for reading in a dark room is nice. Also the ability to set times when it automatically goes to a warmer light is nice as well.

I do recommend this reader, although I wouldn’t have bought it at the current full price. Mine were purchased via Amazon warehouse as used, (almost half the price) and I honestly couldn’t tell the difference. Even if I could discern a difference in condition, I was planning on and did place a decalgirl skin over it so it would have covered any potential scuffs (there were none). I definitely recommend anyone put these on their kindle to give a little personality and scuff protection to the plain kindle.",5.0
13,"The Kindle Paperwhite is a fantastic e-reader that has revolutionized the way many people read. As an avid reader myself, I can attest to the fact that the Paperwhite is an incredibly convenient device to have. It's lightweight, portable, and easy to use, and the display is easy on the eyes, even after hours of reading.

One of the things I appreciate about the Kindle Paperwhite is its long battery life. With a single charge, the device can last for weeks, even with daily use. This makes it an ideal travel companion, as you don't need to worry about carrying around extra chargers or finding an outlet.

Another feature I love about the Kindle Paperwhite is its integration with Amazon's Kindle store. It's incredibly easy to browse and purchase books from the store, and the selection of titles is vast. Plus, with Amazon's Kindle Unlimited subscription service, you have access to a massive library of books for a flat monthly fee.

Overall, I highly recommend the Kindle Paperwhite to anyone who loves to read. It's a great device that provides an excellent reading experience and makes it easy to carry your entire library with you wherever you go.",5.0
14,"My wife was using her laptop with the Kindle app to read eBooks. But her two choices were to sit at a table or hold her laptop on her lap. She didn't think it funny when I said they named it a ""laptop"" for a reason. Anyway, this device was a perfect early Mother's Day gift. Super easy to setup and get eBooks from the local library. She loves the long battery life, easy to read screen, and the fact it picks up right where you left off. Highly recommended by her, and oh by me as well. Happy wife, happy life.",5.0
15,"I've been getting by using Kindle on my Android and iPad for many years but I couldn't pass up a great sale on the Paperwhite, especially with summer coming. I LOVE reading outdoors and my other devices obviously do not work well in the sunlight.

Pros:
Amazing battery life
Perfect size & lightweight
Can read in bright sunlight
No strain on eyes at night
Dark mode + warmth filter
Easy to highlight & use dictionary
No distractions (texts, notifications, social media, web browser.. all the usual things that would interrupt my reading)

Cons:
Slow to react when moving between books and screens. The other day I could not get to the menu to go back to my library despite pressing the right area. It also does not integrate with Hoopla.

These cons are very few over the benefits of having a dedicated eBook reader. Can't believe I waited this long to get one!",5.0
16,"I had one of the earlier kindles, and the screen was so tiny, reading on it was a pain. So then I went to Android tablets with moon + reader and kindle app, and I really liked that combo, but I would find myself replacing my (used) tablet almost every year with another used tablet. Not sure why I was so reluctant to spend money on an ereader, because I use it every night for over a decade when I got my first ereader.

One of the main reasons I wanted an ereader was because like I said, I read at night, and I had probably gone thru 10 different book lights. Most of them had issues with not wanting to stay where I positioned it, being too heavy to be supported by a paperback, or they would just finally run out of batteries and it was cheaper to get something else than to try to figure out how to put new ones in (always specialized batteries). I also didn’t like holding the book, keeping the page open, and I have sensory issues where I HATE the feeling of dry paper against my skin. So the reader took care of all of these things for me.

I’ve been lusting after a paperwhite since they came out, because reading a regular tablet in the sun is almost impossible. When I first opened the package with the tablet, I thought the lock screen was a sticker. Then I realized, nope, that’s all screen! Large, beautiful, non-reflective screen! My near vision is going, so enlarging the font is nice, and I really love being able to look up the definition/pronunciation of a word from from the reader. I got denim blue and a cheap, cute case.",5.0
17,"Dislikes: 1. The touchscreen lacks responsiveness, sometimes have to tap two or more times. This is super annoying. I own a Kindle Voyage that is several years old that doesn't have this issue. 2. The home screen display setup. It's a cluster. 3. The power button position at the bottom right. I haven't hit it on accident yet because I'm a lefty. But seriously, bad location.

Likes 1. Screen size is larger than the Voyage. 2. The e-reader itself is SUPER light - like lighter than my phone. That being said, I did buy a cover to protect it and the magnetic bit does add some weight. AND drum roll please.... 3. The only reason I elected to upgrade (because let's face it the Voyage is pretty much the best ever built) the warm light options. I sit at a computer for at least 10 - 12 hours a day. By the end of the day my eyes are super tired. The last thing I want is to stare at a bright screen while trying to wind down from my day. The warm light options allow me to read without straining my eyes.

Notes: There are less cover options for the 6.8"" screen. The battery life is likely overstated if you read often or a lot on the weekends. I read about 1.5 hours a day. I've had for 2 weeks and it's down to 49% from a full charge. The denim and olive were on sale when I purchased - $30 cheaper than the black. I purchased mostly for the warm light options. I usually return books when finished so don't really require the 16GB storage space.

I cut one star due to lack of responsiveness on the touch screen. It's 2023, that issue should have been resolved by now.",5.0
18,"I bought the very first Kindle back in 2008, the original one with all the buttons, very unwieldy, lol. I have purchased many Paperwhites over the years for both me and my son. My newest one is the latest version, 11. I bought the ""10"" at the end of 2020 and in a little over a year it wouldn't hold a charge. Maybe I should have tried to return it but I decided just to get the new one asI love my Kindles.....well, I did but I'm very very annoyed with this version 11. Why on Earth, after several successful versions of the Kindle Paperwhite, did Amazon remove the ability to remove books from the device without deleting them permanently? Did they think that was an upgrade? I've looked at the Kindle guide on the device, I've tried to find a way to remove from device under Content and Devices on the website, I've googled and read about many many folks who are unhappy with this inability and I have to wonder why Amazon would do this. I don't create Collections, never have and never will, and I'm reading that even if you remove a book from your Collections it still stays on your Library list. I do not want to go through 600 books on my list to find what I want. For years I've been reading a book and immediately removing it from the device so I wouldn't have this problem. I'm charging my version 10 Paperwhite and think I may be using it more than the new one if it'll hold a charge for a few days. I don't really want to keep adding books to the new one that I can never take off.",5.0
19,"I miss my ancient model 2 (second model built) but I finally had to retire it. Yes, it had buttons on the side to deal with, but it wasn't a big deal. This one is much lighter, and the screen is easier to read, but I often have to run my finger across the screen several times to turn the page. Also, it will occasionally bounce to another page other than the next. Using the button to turn the page on my #2 never failed. If I wasn't sure what a word meant, I simply highlighted it, and a short definition would appear on the bottom of the page. I really liked that, but I have not found anything similar on this one. All-in-all, this one works fine and I do not regret buying it, neither would I dissuade anyone from buying this.",5.0
20,"I've resisted getting an eReader for years. I always held the opinion that if I was going to read I wanted to feel a book in my hands. The paper white changed my mind after my wife let me play with hers one night. The screen is very easy on your eyes unlike looking at a tablet or computer screen. Plus the slim profile makes it so easy to carry around that I find myself reading exponentially more than I ever have.
Only criticism is that the kindle store is a bit slow. However, I have to admit and remind myself, this is not a tablet or cell phone, it's an eReader for reading books. Once you have your choice of book downloaded and start reading (using it for its intended purpose) it is phenomenal. I also love the ability to highlight sections of text, or select a word I'm unfamiliar with and immediately get a definition from the internal dictionary.",5.0
21,"I spent days, weeks, debating on a kindle because I LOVE HAVING BOOKS AND HOLDING BOOKS. SMELLING BOOKS!
But I wanted the ease of reading books I don't have yet in a series, without waiting for time to go buy or check out. Granted for me the ""download"" things from Kindle are confusing at times. But with only a couple days in, I'm learning.
I also wanted the ease of reading in bed.

Here are some things I have taken note on.

This is cheaper than the NOOK line. And I have had a nook before, several years ago(the nook still works but slow), and they seem similar but the access of books is easier (for me) with Amazon.
The touch screen is responsive. There is a slight delay but really it's not that breaking for me.
I went with the papaerwhite because of the ""warm light"". I can't do LED full on, all my devices have blue light filters/warm light, ON nearly all the way. So for me that was huge!

You CANNOT download apps to this, strictly books from the Kindle library. There was a update for my new one, for the software. (I checked for an update right after starting it) Which I'm not sure what it did but I CAN DOWNLOAD BOOKS DIRECTLY FROM MY KINDLE, FROM THE KINDLE LIBRARY! Some people said you couldn't, with mine and the update I can.

It's lightweight which is awesome for holding it up at night or in the car. It's also waterproof, so bathtub reading is there, or beach/pool.

You can also use your Kindle app to download books to your Kindle wherever you are at.
You can get Libby and send borrowed books to the Kindle. Again you CANNOT download apps to this Kindle, you have to have Libby on another device and set up your kindle within the app.

I have the ads on mine, it hasn't been disruptive at all.
Reading has been comfortable. As in, it looks like a book page! Which is a small, yet amazing thing!

You can also, highlight words and it instantly look it up via internet, highlight sentences, make notes and such.

You can make collections to add certain books to, which for me isn't really needed but cool.

I would opt in for the free months of Kindle unlimited to just experience it! I like the magazines. Though remember this is strictly black and white so no color pages or pictures.

No headphone jack which is sucky (yes I know less places to get water in) but it does have Bluetooth for headphones.

Mmmm....what else.......
Really for an e-reader, my opinion, this is a great option. Price is of course always something we look at. And I was torn at first, but again the warm light and waterproof helped sway me.

I have enjoyed it so far.

I hope this helps some of you!
Happy reading!",5.0
22,"Perhaps there are enough paper-white Kindles in the world that my review is not needed. But a few days ago I read an article critical of the Kindle and complaining about the lack of ongoing innovation in that space. Wow, that really triggered me! I recall the old saying, ""If it ain't busted, don't fix it!"" The Kindle is exactly what I wanted, just how I wanted it! The readability is legendary from darkest night to brightest day. The battery life is outstanding. The case is durable and waterproof. The device is lightweight and easy to hold. It has vast capacity. The ease of adding content through purchase or transfer is fantastic. Thank you, Amazon, for not fixing it!!",5.0
23,"This is my third Kindle and I was a little surprised how much better it is than the last generation
The biggest plus is a much peppier processor which means you spend a lot less time waiting for something to happen after you push a button or the screen. The previous generation was just deadly slow.
Also appreciate the improve battery life since my old one would only last a few days before needing a recharge.
The small things make it better too.... mainly a slightly larger screen without making the device much larger. They just cut way back on that thick bezel on the previous model. Not sure the warm lighting thing is all that significant but thats new too, if you care.
A worthy upgrade, especially if you trade in your old one and take advantage of related discounts. Lots les than the retail price.",5.0
24,"I’ve been eyeing one of these for a long time but never wanted one because of the price and I hated the flashing screen. Plus I thought my regular books were superior. I got it on sale and I’m so glad I did. I still prefer my regular books, but this is so convenient. It keeps a charge for weeks, fits in my tiny purse, and I can rent library books and send to it.

My only complaint was regarding the set up process. I started setting it up after delivery and Amazon wouldn’t let me decline the kindle unlimited trial. The whole set up process would freeze when I hit decline. I’m really not a fan of Amazons subscriptions because they’re hard to cancel and not super clear on price and inclusions. So just be aware that while this is great, it’s still an Amazon product so they’ll want to sell you more.",5.0
25,"I've never been a reader. I never saw the appeal of ""wasting a day"" with my head buried in a book. However, I received a Kindle Paperwhite as a gift and my opinion changed. It's lightweight and ultra thin making it very easy to carry around in my laptop bag. The battery never seems to die. Only when using the backlight does it seem to move at all. Most of my reading is at night while in bed with my fiancee asleep beside me. The backlight is adjustable so I don't wake her up, which is ideal. The page temperature can be adjusted from cool to warm on a sliding scale. I have very sensitive eyes, but even in the dark I can stare at this thing for hour after hour without strain. The only complaint is that it's a bit slow. The touch screen is overly sensitive and the device is kinda slow making accidental page turns a common (if not frequent) reality. Otherwise it's a great travel companion for when you have down time. It also can be connected to Wi-Fi and Bluetooth which allows you to sync your kindle with the kindle phone app for easy switching back and forth. It's not perfect and I find it has to be manually sync'd to be a useful feature. But cool nonetheless. If they'd fix the speed/twitchy screen it would be perfect.",5.0
26,I cant say enough how much I love this product! It is so incredibly crisp and clear in sunlight while reading at the beach or in a car when sun is shining. The battery life on this thing is crazzzy it lasts for weeks even as much as I read! Charges fast and holds well. Easy to use and had increased my reading significantly bc I find this so easy to use!! Hands down the best thing ive spent money on this year. Also the “ads” were a concern for me initially almost didnt buy bc i was scared ads would pop up all the time. That’s not the case! They are only on the screen while its not being used/sleeping. They turn automatically. But once u wake the machine up and type ur passcode in the ads go away. So they arent a bother and they are only for different books based on what your history shows you reading. So yes save the money and buy the one with add its not a bother. Ive had my machine more than 6 months now and use this every single day! Love love love,5.0
27,"Over the past 12 years I have owned a couple of Kindle Fire models. While I liked the tablets, I found that I was mainly using them to read books, not running apps. I did not like the fact that I was constantly having to charge them - every day or to. I decided to try the Kindle Paperwhite this time around. I am not disappointed. I have had it for a couple of weeks now, and have yet to need to charge it. I do miss the colored screen - it is harder to pick out a book by its cover, but is not a big deal - just something to get used to. The setup was easy - I just followed the prompts, and was up an running in no time. The controls work a little differently than the fire, so it took some reading of the user manual to figure out where to touch the screen. It is pretty responsive - you have to be careful when turning pages. All it takes is a very light tap - much more sensitive than my fire, so I find myself flipping past my page and having to backtrack. Scrolling through your library is a little less responsive, but not bad.
I love the size. Even with a case the paperwhite is so light and easily fits in my purse or even a large pocket. I tried using it without a case. I found it a little slippery to hold by itself. I like it better with the case, and can easily put it in slerp mode by closing the case. It has built-in Audible, and I have already taken advantage by listening to one of my kindle unlimited books that came with an audio version. Overall, I am really happy with my purchase.",5.0
28,"Only thing I would change would be to have the page turning buttons on the side of the reader. So many times I accidentally touch the screen and it will jump to different pages. That being said, the ease of a touchscreen when searching for books makes it easier to navigate. Wish you could access the books that are free for kindle purchase from the actual kindle. If you can, I have yet to find a way. I have to go to the Amazon website from a computer to ""purchase"" the free kindle books. Most of the time I come across them by accident when shopping on Prime, or happen to see them posted in my book related fb groups, or I wouldn't know they are offered free. Not KU free, actually free to purchase. The point in having a kindle is not to have to have another device for Kindle deals/freebies and purchases.",5.0

31,"So I came into possession of this little guy due to a late night Amazon impulse buy a few days before leaving for vacation. I was going on a weeklong trip with my family and didn't want to have to bring my ipad (what I usually use to read) or any actual books with me on the plane. Let me preface this by saying I am an avid reader, spending the majority of my free time reading...and have been for most of my life. My siblings lament to anyone listening about the horror of summer road trips, riding in the back of our family sedan, fighting for leg room because I always had at least 5-6 books at my feet to read during our travels. You should hear the way my sister grumbles at even the mere mention of a car ride with me (She horribly dramatic) but I digress. I also used to have a nook e-reader, an original model Kindle from way back in the day that no longer works, and have the kindle app on my ipad which I use to read most days. So I am familiar with e-reading. This kindle is quite possibly the best purchase I've ever made. It's basically pocket sized so it was extremely portable. I brought it with me everywhere; On the plane, in the car, in my bag to restaurants...I even managed to fit it in a particularly spacious pocket of an oversized jean jacket I wore on cooler nights. It's amazing. It was comfortable enough to hold in one hand, or two, depending on what I preferred at the time. The various light options on the kindle, including the warm light feature makes it easy to read regardless of where I was and what kind of lighting is available, without eye strain. I shared a room with family for a couple of nights and the dark mode feature barely emits light past my immediate person, so I was able to read into the wee hours of the morning if I wanted to without disturbing my family sleeping in the same room, or sacrificing my precious reading time. ( I get particularly sassy if I'm interrupted in the middle of a discovering a plot twist in a juicy novel, i'm just saying). You are able to customize lots of the settings, such as the fonts, size, spacing and layout, so that the books look however you want them to while reading. (I definitely used that feature to make the font smaller and more compact while I read an embarrassingly cringleworthy, but suprisingly emotional and fantastic, harlequin romance novel while on the plane. It's nobody's business why I was practically sobbing into my complimentary pretzels after the protagonists romantic interest declared his love to her for the first time, thank you very much) I also may, or may not have had a TINY accident in which I spilled my entire 32oz water bottle full of water all over my pants and my kindle. After squealing in alarm at how cold the water was, I was able to get my bearings, wiped the water off the kindle, changed my pants and continued reading. I have noted no damage whatsoever to my kindle and that was at the beginning of my trip well over a week ago now. After reading every day for at least 4-6 hours per day/night for 7 days straight I had 57% battery left over. I think the battery is supposed to last for 2 weeks maybe? IDK. Basically it lasted a long time, long enough for me to be impressed. Also, I downloaded at least 15 new books on there, not to mention the impressive collection of books I already owned and was able to sync to the device, and I still have over 4GB of space available to use. I have since named the kindle Kurt, as I feel emotionally connected to the device after our adventures together these past weeks. If you are a super bookworm like me, or are just trying to finish a whole book for the first time, I highly recommend this device for purchase. I think it was worth the money a thousand times over. And if after reading this you do decide to purchase it, I hope you love it just as much as I do.",5.0

I now do not believe this unit is defective. Instead it is a problem with one of the Kindle books.
The problem I was experiencing was this: It would freeze in a blank screen and then sometimes go through a re-boot process. I could get the normal home screen back only by restarting it.
When I received the new one, it was doing the same thing!
After receiving a replacement, I found it doing the same thing. I believe this ebook was causing the problem. ""100 Books You Must Read Before You Die [volume 1]. I got the ebook for free from Amazon.
I wanted to let you know that:
1) The returned Kindle is probably not defective and
2) This ebook creates a problem on at least 2 different Kindles so it may be causing other customers problems as well.",5.0
36,"Since the very beginning of the e-reader era, I had always sworn I would never purchase one. I was proud of being a biblio-purist, and felt that e-readers we're an affront to the ancient, iconic charms of printed literature. Reading a good book could not possibl provide the same experience when done so through the cold and impersonal electronic haze that encased e-readers. How could one derive the same experience that was provided from physical flipping throught dog-eared pages showing sings if all those who had tried through those printed words countless times before, and more to come. Feeling the best of it in your hands carrying the weight of reality, the ever-changing smells that evolved during a book's lifetime from papermill-new, the must and dust that could create olfactory imagery from old, well-used libraries, and the character of cigar-lounds and cognac snifters. These sensations could add timeless, hefty qualities to the works of literature contained therein. I also found afront in that electronic literature kept readers away from the already dying icon of the corner bookstore, and the charms of slowly perusing aisles and aisles of books with others who shared a similar driving passion. And to sip an afternoon capucino on the front patio of such a bookstore was a sublime pleasure that compared to no others.
Then slowly, insidiously over the course of years, my reading frequency decreased. Part of it was due to the inevitable demands for time and attentions that increased age brings with increased responsibilities, but a large part was played by less and less time and energy I had available to make it to the bookstore or library. Slowly at first, but inevitable to the point at which I had simply quit reading without being accutely conscious of it. In would purchase an occasional book, but found that reading simply had become increasingly difficult to make happen. Books would get left in public places, or otherwise lost. Finding room for one in napsack before going on an afternoon bike ride impeded the desire to read. Sometimes I justwould tire of the unavoidable spills, stains, and mistreatments that eventually occured to my books, through no lack of love but due to my somewhat active and chaotic lifestyle.
Then one day after watching a new film adaptation of one of my favorite novels, I had the strong urge to re-read the book. I, however, was on a late-night work schedule that made it extremely challenging to conduct any sort of business or errand-running during daylight hours. Being a devoutly active Amazonian, I was aware of a recent significant sale on Kindles. I ran through a few thought-processes and determined there was little risk of harm in making a small investment in the potential re-Kindling of a long-lost love.
I can't put my Kindle down. I am utterly amazed at the e-ink technology that allows this reading magic to happen. I'm in love with the changeable, resizeable fonts (I can actually read even if I've mis-placed my glasses). The dictionary look-up feature, the ability to highlight passages, easily flip through pages and bookmark them easily, the adjustable side-lighting and color temperature... have all enamored me with the device and customizable technology. And the ability to carry an entire library around with me in my pocket still boggles my mind!
I have read more in the month and a half that I've owned my Kindle than I have in the last 2 or 3 years.
I'm a romantic, tactile person, and while it is a bit nostalgically sad that independent booksellers are losing business and may indeed be a dying breed... well, times change and not always in the precise way we'd like them to. But if e-readers can promote and increase reading and the appreciation of literature, while possibly removing some roadblocks to publication for young, unestablished authors... well I can't see that as a bad thing.",5.0

Upon opening my washer to find it sitting directly on top of the pile of wet cloths, sopping wet, I gasped and may have let loose a small string of expletives.
It claims to be waterproof which usually means like a sprinkling of baptism not a full blown water boarding, but y’all.
IT IS WATER PROOF.
Still going strong today. Zero problems. 100/10 recommend.",5.0
40,"I used to enjoy reading whenever I got the chance to. Now I LOVE reading and make time to read. The Kindle paper white is such a great device. My household owns several kindle fires amongst my children but the paper white is by far a breed of a different animal. It's for the parents. Imagine having a library of books that is light weight and fits in your pocket that you can read multiple different books whenever you want, no glare, no paper cuts, no heavy books. The Kindle Paperwhite makes reading COOL!

I want to buy my wife one!

Everybody needs a kindle paper white and if you have kids get them a Kindle fire 7 Kids Edition. Kindle as a whole has made my families life better and that's a true testimony. Not to mention you can always trade them in towards a new device. Why are you still reading this? Buy it now. Ohhh don't forget a case! Protect your investment... They have cases that will save your page and put the Kindle to sleep when closed.

I'm In Love.

41,"Just got my Kindle White, have it set up and I already love it. For comparison my last kindle reader was from 2009 and used 3G. I loved it but 3G is no longer supported and after 14 years my battery is finally starting to die. I loved the gray scale, easy on the eyes reading with the old kindle. In between I have had two kindle fires which are wonderful in their own right but not for reading. There was too much going on, too many ads, too much color for reading, and too heavy for reading. I read a lot. I have been reading for the past three months on one of the Fires and last week decided no more. I purchased the Kindle Reader, 16 GB's, and NO ADS. I love it. I can set the light for ease of reading, hold it with one hand, barely touch to turn the page, adjust letter size, and download books from my cloud collection, or newly purchased, with ease. I love it. Switched mid book from the Fire to the Reader and enjoying reading with ease again. I can't speak to how long the battery lasts between charges, but it will definitely be longer than the Fire which had to be charged almost every day. One little caveat and it is not a big deal. There is not a separate on/off toggle for the Wi-Fi connection. Turn Airplane mode on to turn off Wi-Fi and vice versa.",5.0
42,"I have had my new Paperwhite for only a week, and it's my first e-reader. So I am still getting acquainted with it. two things so far that are frustrating: the page orientation has only two positions, portrait and landscape, which I knew was not going to be 360 degree rotation like the Oasis. I find this limitation to be frustrating, in part because of the second thing about this Paperwhite model, the USB port and power button are at the bottom of the device, not where you want it to be in portrait position that cannot be inverted on this model. Especially if you have your device in a cover. All I can say is too bad this model was designed with these (and the volume control) controls at the bottom of the device. It would be easier if they were at the top. And you know Amazon deliberately placed it them at the bottom because it has the Kindle title just above that end of the device and it has a wider border for holding it there. Otherwise so far so good. I like reading from it and using Audible to listen to books while doing other things. More later in an update after I've used it a while.",5.0
43,"Mixed feelings concerning my purchase of the Kindle Paperwhite. I find the Kindle to be transportable and easy to read. The screen is functional, but clumsy. Battery life is still under evaluation since I’m a new user of Kindle’s. And the book cover I purchased works well. The physical human factors, i.e., ergonomics, of the Kindle are quite nice.

What I find clumsy with the Kindle:

The major disappoints are based on my personal needs - the reasons why I purchased the Kindle.

I require the ability to reference a lot of technical material, e.g., books. Which is why I purchased the Kindle. It allows me to transport and access more reference books easily.

Unfortunately, too many of my math books couldn’t be downloaded on the Kindle. That’s a major disappointment and defeats the purpose of the buy. It is my hope that that deficiency is corrected in the near future. All Amazon purchased ebooks should be compatible with the Kindle. If not, that incompatibility should be easily communicated before purchase.

Book downloads appear to be manual. When the system sync’s it should automatically download and load the books. My Paperwhite doesn’t do that automatically. I had to literally download each book individually. Add that to poor screen response and you see the problem. It’s a pain for users with many books, repetitive, and time consuming.

Screen response is slow and clumsy. Too slow for, supposedly, the latest generation Kindle. Moreover, touch screen response is fickly. May I suggest the designation of specific spots on the screen to activate certain commands like bookmarks? You have to hit the screen just right. Add to highlight and dictionary function is very clumsy with poor response.

Overall, Out of five I give the Kindle a 3 rating. I am a little disappointed with its functionality considering the length of time the product has been on the market. These problems should have been rectified.",5.0
44,"When my 10th generation basic Kindle gave up the ghost, I debated between the 11th generation basic and paper white models as its replacement.

Compared to the Kindle 10, the higher resolution screen and the transition to USB-C are highly welcomed changes. But these are also available on the Kindle 11 for about $40 less. There are two reasons why I opted to choose the new Paperwhite for my replacement:

1.) The screen is slightly larger at 6.8 inches. I always wished my 10th gen Kindle's screen was just a bit bigger but loved the size. The Paperwhite gains some size and ups the resolution to maintain the quality. For me that's a net win worth a few bucks. The warm lighting that makes for a more sepia rather than white backlighting is nice, but to each their own tastes on that. I'm finding that quite nice for reading in bed, but the ""Just a bit"" larger screen was my real concern. Still too small for Manga IMHO, but still an improvement for novels.

2.) The physical size is almost perfectly a mass market paperback. I loved that once put into a case, my old basic Kindle was more book light and closer to a paperback than a hardcover book in size. That's what I prefer, especially for a device I'll tend to read in bed a lot. Literally, the size is so close to MMPBs I've got that for it to be any closer it would have to come off a printing press. The slightly larger screen is slightly smaller than the text area of said paperbacks, but is darn close.

Combined, for me, that makes it worth the extra cost versus the basic model.

Another realization is that the performance is much improved. My old Kindle was always quite slow and chunky at the UI, but hey, its 90% job was flipping pages not browsing the Store. The flashy screen updating still occurs from time to time as one must learn to expect from these E-ink screens, but the actual update speed is superb. UI feels like it has gone from single digit FPS to normal speed. Page turns are basically instant, literally by the time my eyes move to the top of the screen has already transitioned. While my response to my old model's performance about this was, ""Hey, it was cheap"", the paperwhite just seems to plow through, and I kind of like that.

Overall, for me it's worth the price difference. For most other aspects, the answer is, ""It's a Kindle"".",5.0
45,I like most of it. Sometimes it just shuts down for no reason.I had to replace My previous paperwhite (14 month old) because it shut down and didn’t let me do anything. Warranty was over for 2 month and it just gave out. Can’t do anything with it. Very frustrating. Called Amazon we tried to troubleshoot nothing helped. Bought my present one for 25% off. Hopefully this one will last as long as my first kindle 6 years.,5.0

47,"This is a wonderful product. It allows you to enjoy hours and hours of reading without the eye strain that can happen with phone screens and tablet screens. The font size and style is customizable, which has been helpful with my vision issues. The adjustable backlight and warmth of the light is wonderful for keeping your eyes comfortable. The battery life is incredible. I read for at least a couple hours every day and only charge my kindle maybe once every couple weeks. The product is light weight and the perfect size for putting in a purse, bag, or even large jacket pocket. I have no complaints about this product.",5.0
48,"I wanted to give this review five stars but there are a couple things that actually bothered me about the Kindle Paperwhite. The first thing was that my Kindle paperwork came with a cracked screen. The support team was quick to send a new Kindle but it was disappointing to receive one that was damaged in a box. Other than damaged screen I found that the actual screen itself was a smudge magnet, it's almost as if there's like a clear coat over the screen causing it to smudge at the slightest touch which can be irritating.

Aside from those issues I'd like to mention some positive notes.

First the battery life has improved tremendously and now uses a type c USB which greatly reduces the battery charge time.

The screen is a little bit larger than the original candle I had and due to the change of resolution it's quite a bit clearer.

Something to note regarding storage is that the paperwhite has different storage based on the model and the color. For example the base model comes with 8 GB of storage but the agave green and the denim blue come with 16 GB.",5.0
49,"This is a great ereader tablet, that is very light weight and easy to hold. The screen is easy to see, and the text is easy to read even in outdoor light. The touch screen works well. Unfortunately, the display screen only shows black and white images. This is fine for reading the text in books, but it would be nice to see the book covers in color. It uses reflected ambient light to create the images on the screen. This is a technology still in the stages of further development. It is only a matter of time before color images will be available as the technonogy improves. Battery life is fantastic. I will be using this tablet mainly while we are on vacations. It can hold hundreds of books. For reading books, this is a great tablet. Recommended.",5.0

52,"The reader seems to be pretty cool but do yourself a favor and SKIP the bundle. The cover seems to be made of very, very cheap plastic and the top piece doesn't look like leather at all to me.

53,I decided to get this product because I wanted to read before going to sleep and I wasn't able to with my physical books.

Amazon does like to mess with it though! Last update I used my kindle at, the TOOK AWAY alot of its capabilities! If you put stuff on it that you didn't buy from amazon it would cause problems. Before that update it would not have any issues reading stuff it was able to that you put on it, Open Source books, books from other sellers, PDF, TXT Etc.

And other features for most, if not all Kindles: being able to invert from white background with black letters to black background with white letters, tapping screen to turn pages, option of going to last page read upon awakening the device, variety of fonts and sizes, and many others.",5.0
66,"E-readers are supposed to emulate the experience of reading a physical book as closely as possible and this new Paperwhite is by far the best e-reader on the Amazon lineup and the entire market.

The 300ppi display makes for ultra smooth and hyper-realistic text (and gorgeous images on the lockscreen). Corners and edges look dangerously sharp, lines look pin-straight and un-pixelated, and adjustable brightness and warm light allow for a perfect combination of comfort and realism. The 6.8"" screen allows for more visible text on a page and is only 0.2"" away from the screen size of an Oasis. The brightness of this display can be turned up to 11 and I highly doubt that anyone, even with impaired vision and in the worst lighting conditions, would ever need to max it out. And I like my screens brighter than most. Trust me, you don't need a higher LED count.

The flush-face design is attractive with the downsized bezels around the screen and still provide enough real estate to hold the device. The USB-C port is a must in 2022, the power button is unobtrusive at the bottom of the device (although I would've preferred it placed at the top), and the device itself has a good weight at just under a half-pound. Note: this Kindle is ever so slightly heavier than its predecessors including the Oasis, but is still more than comfortable enough to manipulate in one hand for extended periods of time.

The hardware and software pairing as of April 2022 feels well married. Older reviews have expressed judgement of earlier software versions, but as of today I can report no issues. Pages turn a little quicker, loading screens take less time in decision making, and switching between books and other applications feel faster than ever.

My only judgements about this Kindle are as follows:
I would've preferred different placement for the lock-button but this isn't a functional issue.
I wish this Kindle was available in more colors.
I exchanged this Kindle before writing this review because I received my first one with a pinhole defect in the display. I believe this was due to shipping conditions because the packaging was minimal and the device was placed at the bottom of the shipping box, underneath only a top layer of bubble packing. So, I wish these shipped with better care.

All in all, if wireless charging and auto-adjusting brightness isn't important to you (and it shouldn't be), this Kindle is the one for you. No one needs 32gb of storage in an e-reader, and if you do, it means you're probably neglecting your local library and/ or personal collection of printed books. Shame on you. Thousands of books can be stored in the base 8gb configuration so I truly believe that 32gb is totally unnecessary. Skip the Signature Edition and save a buck.

You can always upgrade to ""ad-free"" at a later date by paying an additional $20 so try the ad-supported version first to test the waters. They only appear on the lockscreen anyway. Kindle Unlimited is laughable unless you strictly read B-level romance novels, so feel free to skip a 3 month trial subscription option at the time of purchase if a Kindle without that option selected will ship faster. You'll also get an offer upon setting up your Kindle for the same 3 month trial, so even if you'd like to try it you'll have the opportunity the moment you login to your Amazon account. The offer will also be forwarded to your email upon initialization.

Buy this one, you won't regret it.",5.0

After buying four of these as gifts over the past year I decided to buy one for myself, and since the 16 GB Agave Green Kindle was on sale I couldn't pass it up. What I like the most is the increased screen size (I didn't think it would make much difference but it is a nicer size, comparable to a paperback page), the adjustable warmth settings (again, comparable to a paperback with cream colored paper), and the page animation which lets me know when I turn the page, or more importantly, when I turn the page by accident. The photos show my old Kindle next to my new 2021 Kindle. Of course, I love that holding a Kindle is easier than holding a print book, I can highlight passages, I can look up words with a touch, and I can virtually carry a library around with me.

80,"First off, I really enjoy using this product. For what it is, it is great. But don't expect it to do more than be an e-reader, as advertised. I have a form of muscular dystrophy, which has limited some of the dexterity of my hands and the nimbleness of my fingers, so having something like this product, which I find very easy for use, makes life just a little bit easier.

My only two complaints aren't so much about the product as they are about the marketing of the product. First, the 10-week battery life claim seems slightly spurious because I've already had to charge the device twice since I bought it, which was three weeks ago. I'm not saying that the 10-week battery life claim isn't true; it could be that the battery would last 10 weeks if the e-reader went unused. But who cares about the duration of the battery life when the product is not being used? It just seems like deceptive marketing. If you're an avid reader who uses it daily, don't expect it to last more than about two weeks, which honestly isn't too bad either. My second complaint is the claim about it being ""glare free."" It is not glare free, but the glare isn't bad at all. If you're reading in the sunlight, you will get a touch of glare, but it is negligible compared to an iPad (or at least my iPad).

Overall, I am sooo happy with the product and glad I made the investment. It's a great size to handle, especially if you're reading something quite lengthy. The reading experience on it is great. There's also an understated elegance and warmth to it. It isn't flashy like so many other electronic products out there today. It might not be for everyone, but I really like it.",4.0

89,"I have used Nook e-readers over the years. A 2010 and 2015 model. The 2010 is dead. The later one is obviously outdated and hasn't been used for a while. My wife used a very early Kindle Fire, also dead. So, I was familiar with Amazon's eBook library and we had many books in our shared library. I decided to update to a Kindle Paperwhite (11th gen) on Prime Day and it has proved a wonderful choice. I've already read about 10 history books in just this last week and I'm looking for more.
.
At 6.8"", the Kindle screen is larger than I've been used to, but that screen makes reading more pleasant and more like a real book. I actually now prefer the landscape mode and have added a Pop Socket to hold the Kindle, since the bezel is pretty narrow. (The PS sticks no problem to the soft rubbery back, after cleaning with alcohol). I have noticed the back really shows greasy finger marks and isn't easy to wipe clean though. The light weight and minimal thickness is really nice for holding for long durations. I specifically don't use a cover, as I did with my Nooks, as that almost doubles the weight and ruins the experience.
.
The touch control could be better, especially when trying to select highlights. The page turns are awesomely quick and the screen illumination is smoothly consistent across the whole screen. The 2015 Nook clearly showed where the LEDs were located! The 300dpi screen is really nice with no pixelation to the letters. I haven't had any ghosting issues either, with the screen page refresh option off. The warmer screen option in dark situations is really nice to read with and I have it set to warm automatically for evening reading. My eyes are much less strained.
.
The non-Signature edition's capacity is fine for me. I don't need to store the whole world's library on my e-reader. I like to read no more than a couple books in parallel, with a handful to refer to, as required. The battery life is absurdly (in a good way) long.
.
In 12 years, the functionality of e-readers really hasn't changed much at all. The improvements have been subtle, but much appreciated. The way books are handled in the library is similar too! The technology development has been much less dynamic on these than say, cell phones. I guess there's not much you can do when the device is basically just for reading. Eagerly awaiting a good color Kindle! (Hint Hint)
I do like the more modern design of the screen layout. It actually is very similar to the old Kindle Fire my wife has and is actually about the same size. Again, nothing really is that new in the e-reader world. The 11th Gen is now quite a bit thinner and lighter though!
.
I do wish Amazon, and others, weren't so restrictive with book formats and DRM's. I can't read my many Nook books on my new Kindle! There are plenty of books in the Amazon store though and I've already rebought some of my favorites, though reluctantly.
.

Loving my new Kindle Paperwhite 11th Gen.! It will keep me entertained and educated for a long, long time. I highly recommend it.",4.0
90,This is a no brainer! It’s a kindle. Perfect size and just the right weight so your hands won’t ache before your eyes do!,5.0
91,"I got the Kindle back in May of 2022 and this was a massive game changer to my reading! The adjustable lights, the adjustable fonts and font sizes, everything about it made the experience better and better.

It's not a lie to say it's been in my purse or on my coffee table or somewhere near my person ever since first charging it - one of the best purchases I've made!",5.0
92,"La compré usada - Buena con publicidad agregada y en realidad la que recibí no traía publicidad. Traía 2 rayones en la pantalla pero no son nada molestos y por casi la mitad del precio original son muy aceptables. Yo usualmente leía en mi celular o en otra tableta, pero tuve una cirugía lasik hace poco y todo el tiempo uso lentes polarizados, lo cual es incomodo para ver en el celular o tabletas al aire libre..... Ahora con la paperwhite puedo perfectamente leer bajo el sol sin ningún tipo de reflejo, o distorsión de las pantallas al traer los lentes polarizados. La batería dura extremadamente mucho. El único defecto es que sí tuve que revisar algunos tutoriales para aprender a usarla, y el touch un poco torpe debido a que no es un dispositivo como una tableta normal. Pero cumple perfectamente su papel.",5.0
93,I guess I did not do my due diligence in reasearching the Paperwhite Kindle. My father-in-law wanted to use a library app and this product does not allow access to apps like Kindle Fire. The only option is free books or to buy the kindle unlimited.,5.0
94,"I'll be honest, I love my Paperwhite and this is my second one.

It is slim and lightweight enough that I can put it in my purse and take hundreds of books with me wherever I go. I can read in direct sunlight or in the pitch black because of the light settings built in to the Kindle. It's different than reading on a phone or tablet, this device doesn't strain my eyes and I can read for hours and I don't get a headache like I would from the light of a phone.

Seriously this is one of the best purchases I have ever made. If you like to read and you are on the fence give it a try. I bet you aren't disappointed and its life changing... it was for me anyways. Happy reading!",5.0
95,"I love actual books but I have a few trips planned and it is just not logical to drag books with me. My daughter said she reads faster on her kindle and she is right. I have been going through books faster than ever. This is so perfect to read while on the treadmill, being able to change the font is a great asset. So compact it fits right in my purse to bring with me everywhere. Easy to use, the light is perfectly adjustable. I still love real paper books, but haven't read one since purchasing my kindle.",5.0
96,"I had an old Kindle fire but only used for reading, this is far superior, light weight & get battery life.",5.0
97,"I am in love this with this Kindle. I debating which one to get for awhile and then decided on this one because it is water proof and can be read in the sun. I love being at the beach and outside during the summer so it was a must have for me. So far I have read more and had access to so many more titles than having a hard copy book. The lighting is just bright enough so that it doesn't hurt my eyes and is great for reading at night. The battery life has been great. For anyone contemplating getting this, it is worth it.",5.0
98,"I compared this Kindle paperwtie 2022 with Kobo Libra 2 and the Oasis all of which I bought. Also I looked very very hard at the new Scribe, And then, after all was said and done I want back to using my Kindle Voyager which has a better screen than any of the above thought the Kobo is a close second,

The Oasis battery life is inadequate. The Paperwhite has overcome that but screen isn't quite as good as the Oasis., The Kobo has the right weight to hold and read thatI attribute to it's plastic construction. This is true of the paperwhite also. AS fr the new Scribe, you have to wonder what idiot made that the same weight as an iPad, no way to hold and read it. Why didn't they make it out of the same plastic as the paper white? Likely a cheaper price too. The Kobo has a great screen because they haven't added an extra screen layer to make the face flush with sides. However, as I started out here, none of them compare with my ancient Voyager which has best screen, lightest to hold etc. It does not have a great battery life but I pit up with that. Who designs this stuff I ask myself? Sure isn't an end user. Build an Oasis or Scribe in plastic, I buy iit even if screen not quite as good as the Voyager. As for the paper white, if they had included the auto light feature on their signature addition without adding another $50 I might have gone that direction,

Okay, well as you can see, Kindle is a terrific system but their hardware is not up to par except in the past when they built the Voyager",5.0
99,"My Kindle was so old that I wasn't going to be able to download much longer. I appreciated the trade-in process and upgraded to a Paperwhite. I took some online advice I went for the device that had ads on the lockscreen thinking the ads wouldn't interfere with reading and I'd save a few bucks.. They don't interfere with reading. However, I keep getting an ad for a romance novel with a sexy, handsome male on the cover and everyone think that I'm reading it, lol. At first I thought it might be too small but I have quickly gotten used to it. I bought a cover with a handstrap which works well. I'm still learning how to navigate, but there are plenty of resources online to ask questions about features. My favorite feature is being able to increase the font. I also got Kindle Unlimited. Unfortunately not every book I wish to read has a Kindle version.",5.0
100,I do like the old fashion way of reading. Something about feeling the pages in your hands and turning the page. The sight of seeing how much you have completed along with how much left you have to go is just something you can’t replace. I have been using it for awhile and downloaded a lot of my favorite books along with some I just recently read. It fits great in your hand and is great for travel. I will definitely be using it for long car ride or airplane rides.,5.0
101,"Love this reader! It’s so lightweight and the screen is very easy on the eyes. Best thing is you can easily read outdoors, there is no glare.",5.0
102,"My 10th gen Paperwhite started acting up so I traded it in for this new one. I really like the larger size. Amazon had updated something and when I went to article view in Wikipedia in my 6"" one, the font was really small. On this new one it's large again and I can actually read it. I definitely need a cover with a hand grip for this one because it's a bit hard to hold, but I got one and it works great. I haven't tried the soft light yet, but it looks nice. It's definitely harder to put it into my jeans pocket, but since I don't normally do that anyway, that's no big deal.",5.0
103,This kindle is perfect! I’ve been wanting to get one for a while and finally made the decision and I am SO happy I did! It’s made reading easy and fun and I love love love it!,5.0
104,"I have always been a ""I prefer the feel of a real book"" kind of person, but I started reading a lot of ebooks from the library, but didn't really like reading on my phone. I splurged on this and am so happy! It feels good in my hand, adjustable lighting allows reading in any conditions, it's water resistant, long battery life, huge amount of storage, perfect!",5.0
105,"I used to have a Kindle that bought ten years ago and it was sill in perfect condition; I just changed it to a newer version because of updates and because it wasn't touchscreen.
Kindle paperwhite has an incorporated light on screen that helps if I turn off the lights at night (although I do not recommend to read with the lights turned off) and it's pretty fast when you touch the screen, sometimes I accidentally touch it and the page changes to the next one or the one behind.
The capacity is more than enough; I never used the whole space with my previous kindle, so this one works just as well for me.",5.0
106,"I bought this model because of the adjustable warmth of the light and it is a game-changer! I feel more comfortable reading at night with the yellow light. Battery life is fantastic, and it feels great in my hand. The only issue is the placement of the on/off button. Why the bottom??? I hold it with my right hand and sometimes accidentally turn it off as I’m ready because my pinky is right there where the button is. Seems silly to have it anywhere near where you’d hold it.",5.0
107,"I like most everything about this Kindle. I've been using the Kindle app on my phone for almost 7 years and switching to this white paper Kindle has been amazing on my eyes. There's no glare or distraction from the rest of my phone while I read.

I have 2 complaints. 1, the touch screen isn't very responsive so there's a slight delay in turning pages. I'm used to the scroll feature on my phone so it may take a little time to get used to the page turning lag. 2, the **mn power button is on the bottom and super easy to accidentally press. I can't stand the Kindle up on anything to read hands free because it'll turn off. It's sooooooo annoying.",5.0
108,"Terrific device, yet the bells and whistles can be overwhelming. Check ""Kindle Basics - A to Z"" for helpful tutorial.",5.0
109,I was on the fence about buying a kindle and I’m so glad I did! I love it so much!,5.0
110,"I long ago discovered the pleasure found in a “reading device”. In fact I do not buy paper books at all any more. I like the fact that I can change the light intensity, look up words, save notes, change type faces and sizes. And for traveling it is the best way to go. Try it and see for your self.",5.0
111,"I ended up returning this because I could not use Scribd with it. Otherwise it's a great device. I ended up getting an Onyx Boox Leaf 2 instead on Target's website using their store *debit* card for 5% off. The white version is what I got because it has a sunken screen which makes the text sharper. It is an Android e-reader, still e-ink, that has the ability to download the Play Store so I can use Audible, Kindle Unlimited, and Scribd on it. Or whatever app you want to download.",5.0
112,"Love the fact I can switch between my iphone, ipad, and Kindle and pick up where I left off.",5.0
113,"per the title, I'm generally happy to have a dedicated reader that is easy to read, at least easier than my phone or tablet. The touch function is not better though. The paperwhite screen is good. I like the kindle fuctions like ""lookup"" and highlighting and taking notes. Battery life is good but the promise is ridiculous. I still have to charge it every couple of days.",5.0
114,"This thing performs so well in daylight and I look forward to reading more books outside regardless of sunlight conditions! So if that's what you're looking for, this is your device.

However, at night I like to read in Dark Mode (or reverse with white lettering on black background) and that is one are that this falls short. I'm sure it has to do with how they designed the screen to be so good in daylight. But when you switch it to Dark Mode, you get a washed out black background (let's call it gray or grey, whichever your preference). So you don't get the sharp contrast that you will find with the other devices (e.g. iPad, Kindle Fire, or Android) that have a black background in reverse screen but suck in daylight viewing. So it looks like I'll use the iPad mini for night reading and use the Paperwhite Kindle for daytime reading. Not my preference, but that's the price to be paid for awesome daylight viewing.

The second area that it falls short is that there are NO options to change the font size, etc. So if you can accept that this displays pages much like a printed book where you get the font size, style and spacing as the publisher printed it, then you'll be fine. I'm just familiar with the Kindle app on other devices where you can personalize the layout for better viewing. I've looked high and low in the few setting selections that it comes with and I found nothing for that. So I've decided to treat it like a printed novel where you have no choices on how it was printed, even though it is an electronic display. Just imagine that it is printed paper and you'll be fine.

The setting selections are very minimal. It would be nice if you could select to have the time display on the bottom margin along with the page number and percentage complete, in my opinion. Some people don't want to have that in view, but I'm often reading while waiting for brief periods of time and would like to keep an eye on the time without having to swipe the screen to view the time - which it is viewable (along with the date) on the quick settings display when you swipe down on the screen.

This device is obviously optimized for daytime reading and it shines in that realm where other devices can't come close. For a simple reading platform with no bells and whistles, it can't be beat - except in Dark Mode. :-)

UPDATED 7/26/22: OK, I accidentally found where you can adjust the font size and select to have the time displayed or not. Oddly you have to do a small swipe from the top to display that portion. Apparently my swipes were always too aggressive and when I swiped a couple of inches, I would get the simple setting screen that didn't have those display options.

After finding that I can get to the settings I was looking for by doing a short swipe, I added a star back onto my rating. Still not able to give it the full five stars because the Dark Mode underperforms to my liking, but that is one small detriment when compared to how well it performs in daylight.",5.0
115,"Supera a la ultima que fue una oasis. Alta definición de pantalla. Muy buena Luz. Apaga perfecto y sobre todo no tiene publicidad. Que no es que molesta pero prefiero que no tenga. Es de peso perfecto, mas liviana que la Oasis, que tenía como una forma que no permitía que este balanceada en la mano.
Excelente producto!",5.0
116,"The new paper white is terrific. Sometimes when making an expensive purchase that I ""don't really need"" I feel a bit of buyers remorse. But not this time. I loved this thing right out of the box. My friends have had different models over the years and I've always been impressed with the screen, and decided to pull the trigger this year on Prime Day.

This new model is like reading actual print on paper. It is very clear, especially outdoors. I think it is more crisp either outdoors or under a reading lamp. The text is a teenie-tiny bit fuzzy when using the backlight alone (ie. in the dark). It totally works, but as a person who needs reading glasses I notice the difference. I enjoy it most when used outdoors.

I've also found that I read faster. Turning the page is quick and easy. And the Kindle is very light weight, it weighs less than my iPhone!! It is easy to hold for long periods of time.

Book purchasing is quick and easy. You can buy on the Kindle, or from your PC and send-to the Kindle. sorry iOS users, Apple has a stick up their butt so you can't buy from your phone.

My only real complaint is the location of the power switch. It sticks out the bottom of the device and is easy to accidentally press. For example, I was reading on a picnic bench in a park and was resting it and my arms in front of me when suddenly a dialog box appeared ""shutdown, reboot..."" I've also managed to turn it on while in my pocket or carrying it to a different room.. I would have located it on the top or recessed it.

Nitpicky ""could be better"" It could use a lock-screen function so that I can carry it to another room. If you accidentally touch the screen, the pages start turning. Or a different book opens, etc. Currently the only option is turn it off. The power options in settings are either ""sleep"" or ""deep sleep"" . Maybe they could add a progressive ""soft-sleep for 10 minutes and then go into deep sleep"". The default deep-sleep takes several seconds to wake up again. Soft-sleep wakes faster but uses more battery.

Another thing, backing up a page requires a Swipe whereas turning forward is a simple tap. It would be nice if a tap in the left side was backwards (for cases when you fall asleep and the pages start turning :-D )

Battery life so far has been 2 weeks between charges. To get the claimed ""10 weeks"" you need to do a few things: turn off wifi (apparently this is the big battery sucker and gets you 6 weeks) and turn off the backlight. And Read Less. :-) I leave wifi on so that it syncs immediately with my phone. 2 weeks is 2 weeks longer than my iPhone lasts.",5.0
117,Vision impaired and had to have 2 surgical procedure. Eyes tired with regular books but for unknown reasons was not as much of a problem with the Kindle. Easy to used especially in bed and does not need a regular lamp ie lets my wife sleep. Somewhat confusing when trying to use library and other features.,5.0
118,This is the second kindle I bought. This one is for my daughter. She liked mine so much I bought her one.,5.0
119,I normally use an iPad mini with the amazing kindle and audible apps. I thought why not try the kindle so I bought a paperwhite gen 11. The one function I really love is called Immersion. This is where you can easily switch from audible (audio book) to the digital reader or even use them simultaneously. Such was not to be on the paperwhite. The Kindle is a wonderful device and the battery life is amazing but this is one feature I don't want to give up.,5.0
120,"Works exactly like it’s supposed too, light, easy to use and read from. Definitely worth they money.",5.0
121,"This model is much like my older one, however, it is much more responsive & reliable. I don't even notice the change in lighting, but it is easy to read.",5.0
122,"In general, I really like it. However, the power button is on the bottom edge. So just about every time I use it, it tries to turn itself off. Very frustrating. The screen gets locked up and you can’t get it to work again until you turn it off and on again. I’m also surprised that the books are a bit high priced. It’s not like they have to pay for the cost of an actual book, it’s a limitless digital copy they purchased and charge us to have a copy. It’s awkward to hold, so I had to buy a phone grip because it’s pretty slippery.
The good things about it is, buying books. Super easy. Of course. You can, like me, donate all of your physical books and only have this with all of them right at your fingertips. Huge space saver. Overall, I love almost everything about having one of these. The location of the power button is bad and super annoying, but I love having it.",5.0
123,"I loved my Kindle Paperwhite so much that I splurged on the new improved model with it’s supposedly impressive battery life. I should have waited until they worked out the bugs because this one is rapidly dying at only 4 months old. A full charge lasts for about a day, maybe two before it notifies me that it’s low, and I have about 10% left. ALERT!! Revising this review, I now give my Kindle four stars. The battery fault seems to be caused by the Fintie cover. Once I changed it back to the clamshell cover it is able to hold a charge normally. The charge is still not as impressive as the ads described but still very good. The clamshell cover is still a fintie cover, so the other more padded book type cover was just a defective one, which I mistakenly thought was the fault of the Kindle",5.0
124,"I regularly thank myself for buying this new toy. I have but ONE complaint. Did Amazon not think we would hold the kindle from the top so they located the power button RIGHT where we need to balance it?! What the hey-na-na?! Next upgrade...put it on the top, out of the way, or make it possible to rotate the screen.",5.0
125,"Love my new lightweight Kindle.
I can take it anywhere , read it in bed without bothering my hubby. I even took it to Hawaii and read it on the beach.",5.0
126,"I used to be a snob about paper being better than digital. But, my husband has a kindle that he loves and uses all the time. I started to want my own for travel and camping trips. It is really handy to be able to bring a LOT of books with you for a long plane ride or something. I also like that it's water resistant. I brought it to the beach a few times and didn't have to worry about splashes getting on it. I have had books get a little damaged on camping trips (cover bent or torn, pages wrinkled from high humidity) but didn't have to worry about that happening to the kindle. It's very lightweight and comfortable to hold with one hand. It's also a great option if you have a small house with limited storage for hoarding a lot of books.

I like the way you can adjust the display as necessary: font size, brightness, white/amber spectrum for reading at night, etc.

The screen doesn't have glare when reading outdoors and refreshes quickly when tapped to turn the page.

So far the battery life has been amazing! I have had this device since May 2022 and I haven't needed to charge it yet. I keep the Bluetooth and wifi off unless I need to use those functions. That seems to conserve a lot of battery juice. When I first got it, I brought it on a trip, reading for several straight hours on airplanes and then about an hour or two per day for a week long trip, then lots of time reading on planes while traveling back home. Since I have gotten back home, I read for a few hours per week. At the time of writing this review, it is July 7, 2022 and I have now had the device for nearly 2 months. The battery hasn't gotten lower than 70% yet! Your mileage may vary, but I have been very impressed.

My only real issue with this device is that is was a bit hard to figure out the navigation at first. There's no instructions in the box, and no tutorial when the setup has been completed. A lot of the navigation functions are hidden unless you tap on a specific area of the screen. As a millennial who is not as tech savvy as some other people my age, I had a bit of a panic when I couldn't figure out how to use it. I had to watch a YouTube video tutorial to learn where to tap to see the different menus! I can imagine someone like my mom or grandma really struggling to figure it out on their own because they are even less tech savvy than me! But once I knew where to tap, getting around the settings and navigating back to my library is not a problem anymore.

I haven't tried using Kindle Unlimited or ebooks from my local library yet. But, I do check the ""kindle daily deals"" and sites like BookBub for discounts on ebooks. Generally ebooks are cheaper than paperbacks. So unless you are someone really thrifty who only buys used books, you are probably going SAVE money on books, instead of spending more. And, I just realized if you set up Amazon household so your account is linked with your spouse or parent who lives at the same address, you can then share ebooks between your accounts. After you purchase an ebook, from your Amazon account you can ""add to household library"" and then you can both access the same ebook. Which is great if your spouse or parent is also a book lover!",5.0
127,I was never an avid reader. I would read in the summer by the pool but it would take me weeks to finish. I have now almost read 12 books in 4 months. It works both inside and outside without having a glare from the sun. Hold a charge for weeks. Love this!,5.0
128,"As an avid reader I love a Kindle.
I traded my 2019 Kindle for this larger 6.8 screen and I love it.
As a full-time RVer my Kindle is a good friend. The battery life on this Kindle is much better than my previous Kindle.
I love the larger screen as I read outside a lot.",5.0
129,"Just perfect for reading. I don’t have the space for a big library like I did in my old big beautiful house before downsizing. Sold my book collection and now I have any and all of them available in this little Kindle book. ❤️ Easy on the eyes. Much better than iPhone kindle app, of course.",5.0
130,So nice and easy for reading. The ad’s are a bit annoying and the screen can be slow/glitchy at times,4.0
131,"Exactly what I wanted. An electronic dedicated to reading makes me feel Boujee lol. I love it and it feels lightweight and easy to travel with. It’s definitely worth the money. I love how it connects to my Goodreads app and automatically updates it from when I started the book to when I finish it, without
me manually having to put it in. My only issue is that I still have a hard time finding a case that fits it.",4.0
132,The battery holds the charge! I read a lot and my old kindle needed to be recharged constantly! I finally splurged on a new one! Very happy with my decision.,4.0

I got it a couple days ago and have already read 2 books, it's easy to handle and carry around everywhere and is a great gift for a reader in your life that wants to save some shelf storage. I can check out and return a book to kindle unlimited in minutes and it saves my wallet from going to Barnes and Noble every time I want to try out a new book. It is definitely worth the money",4.0

137,I have had several kindle and I have tosay that this is my least favorite. I bought this last July. Some things that occur are when I touch the screen to move forward to the next it may take me several pages ahead or backwards. Annoying! Or settings keep popping up. Today it I opened it and after it woke up it went to a black screen.. I restarted it but not holding the button for 40 seconds which is not the easiest thing to do. Called customer service and she was very helpful. Amazon you need to step up your game for future models!,4.0
138,"Sientes como si estás leyendo en papel. Nunca había tenido un ebook reader y la experiencia ha sido muy buena. Lo unico que veo es que el procesador no es tan rápido cuando estamos cargando un libro.

140,"I had one the original Kindles when it came out but I was still in middle school then and didn't do much reading. I found the device slow and laggy, and the screen's ""warm mode"" was awful. It was like a murky orange overlay just put over the screen. It was unreadable for me.
No so with the Paperwhite! The display is much more responsive than past models, and it looks great to read on! The screen is very easy on the eyes. The warm mode is now much better and perfect for my late-night reading. What I love most is the portability. It's smaller than an iPad so it easily slides into my backpack or laptop bag when I want to take it somewhere. But, I've also found myself reading on it more and more at home!",5.0
141,Love my kindle paper white! It honestly reads the same as a book and does not hurt my eyes as I am someone who gets headaches from screens.,5.0
142,"I was stubbornly anti kindle for years but I was accumulating too many books not to mention the cost. I've had this kindle paperwhite for a couple months and have really enjoyed using it. It's easy to take with me, I can read at night in bed without having a light on, it's much cheaper than buying books and I don't have to worry about where to store them. I wish I hadn't waited so long to try it.",5.0
143,"I looked at several variations of the Kindle products. I decided I did not need the fancy additions of the top of the line model, I just wanted to be able to read books. I did buy a case for it, that has a loop for a hand hold and found that makes it more comfortable to hold it for long periods of time when I read in bed or on the couch. The battery life lasts a long time. I downloaded a couple of books on it and took it on our 7 day cruise. It was fabulous. Lightweight, took up less space than packing actual books, and was easy to read in bed at night or in the sun on the pool deck.

Sometimes the touch screen seems to respond a little slow, but maybe that is totally normal. I am used to the speed of computers and iPads.

Speaking of iPads, I much prefer reading books on my Kindle over my iPad. Less tiring on my eyes, lighter weight to hold, and seems more like reading a book. It is NOT colorful. It reads like a black and white paperback. I think you can adjust some settings to change the brightness, but there is NO color. So if you like to read things in color this is not for you.",5.0
144,Works as expected. The delivery was a bit of an issue. Not sure what that was about. Had to cancel the 1st one because it was lost and thus one came late. I usually never have an issue but something to think about if you are counting on the 2 day delivery for a gift. Maybe best to purchase locally,5.0
145,I am very happy with my Kindle Paperwhite (8GB). It's light weight and fits in my purse for traveling. I love that you can load books in advance of travel which I highly recommend. Many hotel wifi's do not support downloading books on the Kindle which is the only downside I have discovered. I also use it to download library books as well. I enjoy switching back and forth between the light and dark modes depending on my surroundings. Fabulous purchase!,5.0
146,"After 8 months of consistent use, I'm finally ready to review this device from the perspective of a post-graduate/student studying for certifications.

I'm a somewhat recent college graduate who, before, hadn't read a book since high school and was just as unwilling to go out of my way to buy a book I likely would start to read and forget about halfway through. That said, prior to trying the Kindle out, I was just as unwilling to switch to an e-reader - adamant in my own head that I can't stand reading on anything other than paper. With that out of the way, here's my review.

Pros:
- The e-paper display, though purely monochromatic, allows for very easy reading that honestly doesn't differ much from printed text.
- Due to the type of display used, battery life is almost a non-factor. The 'screensaver' will distract you from that and I admit, it took me a while to get over. If it's that big of an issue, you can always get a case with a front cover (the Kindle will lock automatically when 'closed')
- Selection of books on Kindle Unlimited are vast and many. Furthermore, importing other documents or e-books downloaded on your PC is as easy as emailing said files to your Kindle - though the instructions to do so could've been a little clearer. My free time has been taken over as such from reading novelizations of my favorite manga.
- If you're a student with a lot of required reading or a need for supplementary material of any kind, I think you'll find the Kindle to save you both time and money (most importantly).

Cons:
- Aforementioned e-paper display will turn off people who aren't as familiar with the tech. It's nothing comparable to the newer LED/OLED/MiniLED displays on your phones or tablets; it's meant to run minimal power for its function, a feature I came to appreciate but came with some patience as well.
- Something I hadn't noticed until using for some time is, though I can always 'zoom' to increase/decrease text size, that I wouldn't have minded going for a larger display - strictly for comfort.
- I hate how the 'lock' button is on the bottom. I usually use my pinky for my book to perch on while I read but trying to do so here left me fiddling with a locked Kindle more times than I'd like to count. I countered this by getting a case with a strap on the back by which I can hold the device, but after a while, it didn't take long for me to get over it and avoid that spot entirely.

Ultimately, I wish I had purchased this device during college. From a student's perspective, it's invaluable considering the costs of textbooks. Even now, as I pivot from my degree to a totally new field of study, there are countless books on Kindle Unlimited I can use for reference. From deep philosophical thought experiments by Einzelganger to RPi4 and Arduino projects, the Kindle is something you may not use everyday but you'll be very glad you bought one whenever the need should arise.",5.0
147,"I purchased my 6th Gen Paperwhite in 2013 or 2014, so it's held up well considering. I believe I purchased it refurbished, too. So that says a lot about the quality and longevity of the product. There is nothing wrong with my 6th Gen Kindle; it's in perfect working condition. But because it's almost 10 years old, I wanted to upgrade. SO GLAD I DID. First, the screen resolution is much better and brighter (212ppi vs 300ppi). The screen is noticeably larger in a good way (6"" vs 6.8), but still feels comfortable while holding with one hand. I love that I can listen to audible books (requires a connection to a Bluetooth device as there are no speakers on the unit). While I do have a Kindle Fire HD 10 Plus, I prefer reading fiction on the Kindle Paperwhite. Overall, this is a big improvement over the 6th generation specifically, and I couldn't be happier.",5.0
148,"I have been a Kindle user from the beginning. This is my 4th one. This one is also as far as benefits, I am not seeing it. In theory, the essentially having to charge approximately 4x a year. I've had this for about a month and have charged it 4x. Do I use it a lot, and got extended times, yes, but geepers in dark mode and on 7 I shouldn't be charging it as often as my smartwatch...I've also noticed the sending back of books under KU and getting new ones is exponentially slower than past Kindles. I have to shut it all the way to reboot to get the books to load. That gets annoying real fast. The only reason I got this new one was because my old one is nearing EoL. It lasts a day and the screen had a flicker. I figured a new one would be a winning option.",5.0
149,I debated for over a month on whether to buy the new kindle paperwhite. I recently started reading again after stopping social media. I was reading on my phone & iPad and noticed it was straining my eyes. I been eyeing which one to buy & very pleased with this one. It was way smaller than I expected & took me back a bit when I seen the size but it's very portable and easy to stuck in purse. Heck it might fit in a mans jeans pocket. I do really like the c USB charging port so I dont have to look around for a charger I've always got a charger with me. I've only had to charge it once in 2 weeks & im a daily reader. I also purchased the kindle cover case which I don't care for because of the way I hold it to read while laying in bed a night. I ended putting the case on backward so it's easier to grip while laying on my side to read. I do wish they changed where the off button is I've accidentally turned it off a view times while reading. The device is very light & although small I think it's size is perfect know that im reading on it. The touch screen is very responsive. As I have accidentally flipped back and forward accidentally while reading I place my fingers on screen as I read to hold. Its just small things I've found I dont like but nothing bad enough to make me return the device as I am still very happy with it. If your new to e-reading like I am I think you will be very happy with this device,5.0
150,I absolutely love this kindle! My first time purchasing a kindle. I was always against e-readers because I love the smell of a fresh book and love going to book stores but mannnn this thing is a game changer. I read 4 books already in less than a month when I couldn’t even finish a single book last year. Always spacing out or getting distracted… not with the kindle. 10/10,5.0
151,"I'll break it down as briefly as I can

1) USB C - finally

2) Battery life - like my dumb Casio watch: something that I don't have to worry about. After I owned my Oasis for a while, I bought one of the last gen paperwhites to carry it around with me in situations where I would be less devastated if it became damaged. Then, I became mad at how much better the battery life was on the paperwhite. Now, my new paperwhite blows the old one out of the water (I've only owned the last gen one for two years and have only used it lightly). This is how I wish all technology was: charge it up for about an hour and then you're good for at least the next two weeks.

3) Speed - I didn't have the new Oasis, but from my understanding, the generational differences only include the warm light. I did a side-by-side between this Paperwhite and the Oasis and in every situation that I saw, the Paperwhite was at least as fast as the Oasis and sometimes faster.

4) Feel (Ergonomics) - The Oasis is ergonomically the worst kindle amazon has made since the original kindle. I don't say that lightly. I wanted to love how the Oasis felt because I did love how it looked. But between the harsh metal edges all around the front face of the device and the oil/sweat slipping against the aluminum back, it was impossible for me to read without consciously thinking about it. Then, I would use my last-gen Paperwhite and, again, become annoyed by the reality that I enjoyed how it felt better. This Paperwhite has the same design on the back of a very grippy rubber/plastic substance that allows the device to be held securely without consideration. There's one thing I've left out until now: one-handed reading. The whole point of the Oasis' asymmetrical design is to make that easier. So, there it is. That's the thing I gave up, right? No. The fact of the matter is that all the ergonomic support provided by uneven distribution means nothing when the metal shell feels like a banana was smeared all across the back. The Paperwhite is fine in one hand because of the way that the back allows for optimal grip to be maintained.

5) Screen size DOES matter - As much as I disliked many things about the old Paperwhite, I could never give up the screen size. That extra inch of screen changes everything. Then, the new Paperwhite came out and I knew what I had to do.

6) Warm light - Just another thing that removes the barrier of technology from the reading experience.

7) Price - $15.92 No, seriously. A price drop on top of a promotion on top of a trade-in allowed me to walk away with this Paperwhite for just that. But even if it didn't, there's a $120 difference between the Oasis and the Paperwhite signature edition and a $140 difference between the Oasis and the regular Paperwhite. I cannot find a way to justify the price of the Oasis when the Paperwhite can do all of the same things just as well.

Anyways. Hope this helps anyone asking themselves if they should go for the Oasis instead. The answer is a resounding ""No"".",5.0
152,"I have never owned a Kindle before and always read from my phone or a previous tablet. I did a lot of research trying to decide between the paperwhite and the traditional Kindle. Then when the new colors came out of the paperwhite a few weeks ago and were only a few dollars more then the traditional Kindle, I decided to purchase. I absolutely love this Kindle. I am one who also likes the feeling of a traditional book, and I feel like the paperwhite gives you that feeling. I decided to go with this one versus the traditional because I am hoping to read outside when warmer weather approaches and I have concerns if it accidentally became wet. So far, I love the Kindle Paperwhite!",5.0
153,"Thank you for offering the trade-in program. I got $25.00 for my old kindle plus 20% off a new kindle (total $59.00). I’m so in love with this new paper white. It came with 3 months unlimited for free so I’ve been reading several books a week! It’s lightweight so I keep it in my purse and pull it out to read everywhere. I adjusted the setting so the font and lighting is perfect for me and I’m loving this device so much. My battery doesn’t last as long as the other reviewers and I’m not sure why.maybe because it’s on Wi-Fi or maybe the brightness of the setting I have it on? It’s not a big deal because I have to charge it each night so Ive been able to read on breaks at work, in waiting rooms, waiting in the car line at my daughters school, just everywhere. I feel like people who enjoy reading will renew their excitement with an easy to use device that this version is. I’ve discovered a new to me author on Unlimited named Freida McFadden and I intend to read her entire catalog that the kindle library has so thank you for the free trial and for making the return of my trade in kindle so easy.",5.0
154,"My kindle lost its battery life in Florida and I bought this one. Absolutely loved using on the beach. Could see what I was reading.

I have been home a week and a half and still haven’t come close to needing to charge it. Highly recommend.",5.0
155,"I graduated to the Paperwhite from my Kindle Touch based on recommendation from my ophthalmologist. I had been doing all my reading on an iPad.
The best feature of the Paperwhite is the screen. Less stress on the eyes.
Not so great issues: the system processor is slow; cannot find a search function in the user guide; screen is very touchy, fat fingers can move you up or back 10 pages; behind the scenes functionality like setting font, brightness, etc., are not intuitive like an iPad.
In my opinion the Kindle app for iPad is the best, fastest, and most intuitive program for managing your books from Amazon. Depending on your eyesight, the Paperwhite is much less stress on your eyes.
Update: now experiencing long lags between touching the screen and resulting action. Will not scroll back to previous pages. I have to go back to the beginning of a chapter and scroll forward to find what I am looking for. Also highlights feature does not always work.",5.0

Worked out the tech part, borrowing from library, buying, etc. But the screen and sitting/prone position was sometimes awkward, hurt my wrist! Then my step-son came with his Paperwhite (and old one) and I my eyes were opened. It was much lighter and much better than my tablet. PLUS, he was on a long vacay from Europe and not at all worried about charger. Last weeks he said. Got one the next week (insisted on one without pesty ads). Plan on enjoying it for a long long time. I can read lying on my side and with a flick of my finger, the page is turned. Very restful (and fast) way to read!",5.0

I absolutely love this kindle it is amazing and the back light is perfect for when you’re lying in bed can’t sleep and your mind is wandering and racing. Open your Kindle and get your nose into a good book. Pair this with the Kindle unlimited program and you can read until your little hearts content and browse through today’s top magazines. I highly recommend this for any active reader or anyone wanting to Get their fill of the next crime novel. This is also good for children. I think there’s a children’s version as well. Just make sure you get a protective case and a screen cover protector with it.",5.0
158,I’m so glad I bought one of these. Specifically this one. I was hesitant since there’s cheaper ones but I’m happy. Love that I can read with the light off. The warm light setting is awesome. Easy on the eyes.,5.0
159,"The only thing that got me to upgrade to this kindle from my 3rd gen kindle was that my older version's battery stopped taking a charge. It was like losing a faithful pet and facing the uncertainty of a new one living up to the standards set by the one you lost.

I'm a bit of a luddite when it comes to electronics and prefer them to be as simple as possible. I still prefer holding a paperback novel, but I've come to enjoy the portability a Kindle brings to one's book collection. I hate the constant need to re-learn new software, though, hence my resistance to upgrading until I had to.

If you are anything like me, I can assure you that there are features on this version of Paperwhite that will grow on you even as you miss features you no longer have. Here are my pros and cons:

Pros:
-Backlighting and its adjustability makes for comfortable reading, especially in the dark if your partner is sleeping next to you. I used to have to get up and go to another room because my old Kindle had no lighting.
-good battery life, especially if you keep it in airplane mode unless you are downloading a book.
-Your library list tells which books in your collection you have already read, which are partially read, and which are new. Not a critical feature, but nice. I wish they would tell you which one they are in a series, though. That would be even more helpful.

Cons:
-This Kindle doesn't have has much area around the screen to hold the kindle without accidentally touching the screen and turning pages when you don't want to. A case is a must to help with this, but that adds weight to holding it. It makes me miss the buttons on my gen 3 Kindle.
-I don't care for the icons for book titles when you are searching for a book. It's attractive, but the artwork makes titles harder to read when they are so small and this version doesn't let you switch to get a simple typed list view. I've tried and searched on line for help to be able to do this, but none seem to apply to this version. You also have to do a lot more scrolling because only 6 icons fit on a screen at a time.
-Trying to find what you are looking for can be like getting through a phone tree. It takes too long to find what you need. Maybe it would be an easier transition for customers not using a Kindle as old as mine was, but after several months, I still find I have to really hunt to remember where a feature is.
-No More Whispernet! You have to be around a router to download books. I don't travel as much as I used to, but the ability to download a book in a moving car was a wonderful thing and I know I will miss that. --I'm not crazy about the extra step to download a book after I purchase it, either. Why is that no longer automatic if you are connected?",5.0

I can read in the bright sun or shade, the dark, anywhere at all. I got a cover for it that will stand up, its perfect. I have read more books in the past 8 weeks than the past 3 years. I got it with the free 1 year of Kindle unlimited, which doesn't get you every book under the sun but it gets you enough and with a free year of it. . . . hey why not!

175,"The product is a great device for people who probably want to highlight their content and go through the content they highlighted. For education, I’d say it’s not too bad, and not too good based off experience.

If more RAM was on this device, responsiveness of the device could be far better. When it goes to screen orientation, there are only two directions for holding the EReader. The issue here is if the device is held with the right hand, chances are a person could accidentally flip to the previous page.

Battery life is outstanding in terms of how long it lasts on a single charge and how time convenient the EReader is to fully be charged.

The only issue I would have to state is the responsiveness for changing pages and having to restart the device to get the device to be more active. Trying to type fast is not a good idea for an EReader as it is obviously clear that the device is only meant for reading, and not typing.

Fonts, spacing, the dictionary, and customizability: the font sizes and font types are quite great. Not to mention that the EReader does let the reader know how much of the book is covered and what the time is, except for the fact that at certain times of the year, time does change by about two hours, which I really should say adding such an automatic feature would be good.",5.0

181,"Overall, I LOVE my new kindle paperwhite. Can't stress enough that it really has overall been a great purchase. I love having a dedicated e-reading device as other things don't interupt and distract my reading time, etc... I now refuse to read e-books on any other device as I much prefer reading on my Kindle.

Pros:
-Absolutely love the adjustable warm/blue light options and dark/light mode (as I can read comfortably in the dark without disturbing others)
-In love with the fact its waterproof so I can read in the tub/pool/etc...
-wifi connectivity awesome feature
-The kindle store experience isn't as good as it is on a tablet/smart phone but was way better than expected
-size and weight are just right for holding and reading.
-I've read it several hours a day and the battery still managed to last at least a week plus. And if I don't read as often and leave it in airplane mode with bluetooth off it lasts a very, very, very long time without re-charging. So no complaints there.

Cons:
- Biggest con is as of 2022 kindle paperwhite doesn't support immersion reading (i.e., listening to audiobook and seeing book text at the same time) you can only do one or the other/switch between the two. As an exclusive e-reading device I was very disappointed it doesn't support this particular feature.
-It occasionally glitches either skipping ahead by several pages, or makes me tap/swipe a few times when I attempt to navigate backwards in my book. Its not a deal breaker as it happens rarely but still can be slightly annoying at times. This may also improve with updates in the future.
-The screen does smudge quite easily/noticably but when reading you can't really tell
-a little sad it doesn't have its own speakers to listen to audiobooks, but I knew this buying it and it does connect well to my bluetooth devices. Also, not including internal speakers does keep it very slim which is nice.
-There are one or two e-books I own that ""aren't formatted"" for the kindle so I can't read them, but its quite rare. Also I wouldn't recommend reading comic books, graphic novels, or childrens picture books on a kindle as they are all black and white and don't show color (and the pages are smaller and text can be quite difficult to read) However none of these books really read well on normal tablets/smartphones either as they are usually best as hard copies. That being said my toddler still enjoyed reading the one or two kids picture e-books I do own on the device. But its best and really designed for text only chapter books for older kids/adults.

Other comments: other reviewers mentioned that the power button is not in a good location as its on the bottom of the device. They stated they occasionally accidentally turn it off while reading (especially if you hold it right handed). I agree its in a bad spot/is slightly inconvenient but it hasn't caused me to accidentally turn it off. So overall this hasn't been an issue for me.

Overall I would buy it again, and I would definitely purchase the paperwhite over the standard kindle if you can afford to (although the standard is still a good experience).",5.0

The matte screen and easy to adjust illumination and text size is perfect for day, night reading. I enjoy reading it with the room blacked out at night. I also enjoy the fact you can just prop it up and easily flip a page when it is time without using both hands to hold the book.

- it's easier to read and take multiple books wherever you go, or even just grab another while you're out.

- the battery lasts forever, it's easy to navigate, and super easy to read.

Coming from a 7th Gen (that met all my needs), and three previous generations, this latest iteration is just ok. Larger memory-7th Gen met my needs. Do people carry their entire library downloaded with them? Flatscreen - no bezels-nice. Power button on the bottom-already accidentally shut it off. USB-C charging port-wife and I also have a Fire, so old charger still needed. You can flip it! No worries about orientation-nice I guess. Sharper print-not so I can notice. White on black background for night reading-don't like it. Maybe I need to try it again. Warm light-I have it set for minimum. I like a white page. Waterproof- not a biggie for me. 20% faster page turning-not really noticeable to me. Longer lasting charge life-too soon to tell. But I plug in almost every night, so maybe if I still traveled for work I would appreciate this more. Leather cover-nowhere near as nice as the leather cover on my 7th Gen.

Ultimately I would certainly recommend to someone on the fence, however if your 7th Gen is working properly and meets your needs, I'd stick with it. From a daily reader, Cheers.
Edit: Just wanted to add that I had issues regarding this device and was taken care of by Amazon. Some folks are slamming Amazon for poor customer service. I found their customer service to be exceptional in my case.",5.0
203,"My wife is really the book worm of the house and wanted to get one of these, but the price was such that I decided I would love to have one by the bedside so I could read at night without any distracting notifications or temptations to goof off on TikTok, etc, so I got one too. It’s great for that - night reading - I strap it to my hand with a rubber band and never drop it on my face as I start dozing off like I do my heavier, harder iPhone.

What I didn’t expect is that I would totally fall in love with it and carry it around the house with me, looking for opportunities to read throughout the day. At this point I would rather read with this than a real book or any other mechanism, and I’m actually reading again… something I fell out of the habit of doing until now.",5.0

205,"I took advantage of Prime Days to get a Kindle. Now, I’ve had a few days to evaluate it.

I’ve heard critics of the device say that they want the smell and feel of a “real book” and have no use for such a new-fangled device. Such remarks remind me of the late Phyllis Diller. She was notorious for her obsession with plastic surgery. When a reporter wanted to know how she felt about people who say they would never have such surgery because they think nature should take its course, she responded: “Well, let those people grow old gracefully then.” Fear of anything different seems to hold folks back more than a granite wall.

If you think a conventional book is better than a Kindle, you might as well get an icebox, throw out your refrigerator, live without air-conditioning, build yourself an outhouse, and get your liquor from an old fruit jar. Okay, maybe that’s a little strong; I, too, like holding a book. But from now on, they’ll need to be room in my life for both.

Perhaps your hesitation about getting a Kindle is because you don’t really love reading that much or don’t completely understand all a Kindle can do for you. The Kindle is to the book what a book is to drawings on a cave wall. In the next paragraph, I’m going to sell you on getting a Kindle, and I don’t even get a commission. I will, however, accept your thank you.

You probably already know that you can read a Kindle in the dark or outside in bright sunlight, and the screen is no-glare. But did you know that you can press on a word and the dictionary definition will pop up? You can press and hold while you run your finger across a sentence, paragraph, page, or whatever and it will highlight the same way you would use a highlighter for a book. It will stay highlighted unless you delete the highlight. You also have the option to write a note on anything in the text you want: a word, a paragraph, a page, whatever. You can even email your highlights and notes to yourself. When you stop reading, the Kindle will keep your place. The battery life is insanely long, and the device is much easier to hold than a regular book.

If that paragraph didn’t convince you, let me add one more fact: you can get a high-capacity Kindle for a little more money than I spent. However, the one I got – the Paperwhite 6.8 -- gives me a good view and, with 8 GB, will hold an average of 2000 - 3000 books. I said, two to three thousand books. Thank me later.",5.0

This unlimited is a far better deal after the initial investment of the Kindle. If your frugal you should buy one on black friday around 40% off that i recall.

There are plenty of Kindle generation comparison reviews out there already, so I won't go down that path. What I will say is that the battery life is really exceptional on this paperwhite, probably on-par or better than all my previous Kindles. The text quality is very good, the ad-screens are not annoying, and the touch screen is adequate for navigating books and my kindle book collection. The wifi is solid and I have not had any issues with it at all. In addition to that, it is extremely light and easy to hold for hours at a time without fatigue or cramping.

225,"Everything is good in this new Paperwhite model, I like the bigger size and the backlighting with variable ""warmth"", plus the optional dark mode of white text on black background for night reading.

I don't like the lack of dedicated page turn buttons -- I've always had older Kindles with buttons, most recently a Voyage, and I find it distracting and annoying to have to touch the screen carefully somewhere on the righthand side to advance forward one page, especially if I'm trying to hold the device in just my left hand, as I would often do with the older models having dedicated page turn buttons along the left edge. So I can't use this Kindle entirely one-handed like I used to with older ones (even holding it just in my right hand, it's awkward having to extend a finger carefully to touch somewhere in the righthand side of the screen to advance the page forward instead of just having a nice button to press).

Oh one other thing that's sub-optimal is that in the new OS/UI there's no more generic/universal ""Back"" button/link icon. Most noticeable when I'm reading a story in a magazine; with older models and older OS/UI there was a ""back"" button, either hardware or software, so I could use the ""home"" button/link icon to jump out to the ""library"" listing, and then use the universal ""back"" button/link icon to jump back directly to the page I'd been reading in the story in the magazine. Now I have to go through several steps, thinking about what to do/touch next, to go through this cycle, and it annoys me each time.

Plus, one more thing I don't like in the new OS/UI is that in the Library listing when I have some Collections, previously in the overall view it would only show collections and individual items that weren't in any collection. So I could ""hide"" a bunch of books inside collections, not having to scroll past them in the main library view of items not in any collection.

But now, in the overall view, it shows collections and ALL downloaded individual items, including ones that I wanted to hide from this view by putting them in a collection. What's the point of adding them to a ""collection"", if they're still just going to all be visible in the main library list?

Other than these few things I don't like about the new OS/UI and the lack of a physical page forward button on the left or bottom edge of the device, I do like this new Paperwhite (it's my first Paperwhite; I had the original Kindle when it first came out, then some years later I had one with no keyboard but still having physical buttons along the bottom and sides, and then I had a Voyage for a few years, before deciding to upgrade to this new Paperwhite).",5.0

229,"I am an avid reader, with over 1000 books on my kindle. I read for at least an hour a day. I've owned all versions of kindles since they first came out, with the exception of the Oasis, which I purchased and returned due to readability issues. My favorite kindle ever is the Voyage, which I still have - several years old and still working fine. I say all this to give some perspective on this particular kindle.

I purchased the new kindle paperwhite in November of 2021, and loved it. It's the most similar to the Voyage that I've found, with the exception of not having actual buttons to push to change the page. The paperwhite is light, has a large screen so page turns are lessened, easy to hold in your hands, and has rapid and invisible page changes with no delays. The e-ink is deep and dark and easy to read. I'm not a fan of the new software and find it hard to hunt for books in my library, but was willing to put up with it as I really liked the product. For avid readers, the charge does not last for more than ten days in regular mode, but overall I was very pleased with it.

Fast forward nine months later... A line across the text started to form when the kindle was on the Lock Screen. I turned it off and on, checked for updates, and continued using it. The line then began to show even on the page I was reading. After an online chat with Amazon customer service, they agreed to exchange it for the refurbished kindle paperwhite. I take issue with this practice of replacing almost new, under warranty, defective merchandise with something that is not brand new, but I asked for new and was told no, I had to take a refurbished item. After receiving the replacement kindle, I noticed the plug in port was difficult to get the plug in, and got gradually worse. I called in CS in November as now the replacement kindle was not charging even when I could get the plug in. I had to speak to three people, explaining the problem each time over the course of an hour. I was told I'd have to pay to ship my kindle in and get a replacement, that I could only get a refurbished item again, etc, etc. I finally, after insisting, got transferred to a supervisor who agreed to make an ""exception"" and send me a new kindle. However, I wouldn't have a warranty on the new one, so if anything didn't work on it, too bad.

Why does a loyal customer with a legitimate issue have to waste so many hours to get an in-warranty product replacement, and then have to accept a replacement with no warranty on it? Amazon, get it together. This should be an easy fix from the customer standpoint.

In conclusion, I like the paperwhite, but am, with good reason, wary about the longevity of the product. If Amazon can't stand behind their signature e-reader with better customer service than I got, I can't whole heartedly recommend it.

I also love that I have the ability to purchase books directly on the Paperwhite instead of having to get on the website and have it sent to my library and then retrieve it on the app. HOWEVER..... the audible user face on the Paperwhite is a joke compared to the Audible app on my phone. The app has more options such as the sleep timer & player settings (progress bar, choosing how long forward & rewind are & continuous listening). The scroll option to go between chapters is laughable. A pop up window appears & I have the most difficult time getting it to ACTUALLY SCROLL!!! I've tried using the line to the right hand side where a scrollbar is typically placed, I've tried hitting where the 'up arrow' & 'down arrow' WOULD be on a typical scroll bar, & I've tried using the area where the chapters themselves are actually listed.

Having had these three generations I can say that the 10th generation (2020) was my favorite. I enjoy having the long battery life as I am an avid reader and the weight is a noticeable difference from the 2014 version. When I received this one I was nonplussed. Yes the battery and weight were nice, but that 6.8"" display was not to my liking. I sometimes will hold the kindle in one hand, and having small hands, it is almost impossible now. I am sure if I ordered a case it would be.

234,"I love Kindle! I've owned one almost since they were introduced (remember the keyboard Kindle!) and they have literally changed the way I read. No more locked onto so called best selling authors because now I can discover the absolutely amazing talent that exists out there in the independent world. It also lets me tote as many books as I want on vacation without needing a separate suitcase for reading materials.

And, every generation of Kindle has seen an improvement, some dramatic, some subtle. This one is on the subtle side if you own a 2018 version. Yes, the screen is bigger but so is the whole unit (marginally but still bigger) which is not necessarily a check mark in the plus column. The screen shows fingerprints badly, just like the 2018 version so a screen saver is helpful if you can get it installed properly. I really like the USB-C charging - a small idea but one I can appreciate.

Where I have some issues with this generation is that it seems buggier than any version before. Sometimes the page forward doesn't work until you do a page back first and then all is well for about another twenty pages and then the behavior repeats itself. It doesn't always turn on/off with the cover close and I've tried two different covers so think it's the unit itself. The first thing I did when I took it out of the package was to update it but it has since, on its own, gone into that update screen when there wasn't actually any update to download. It doesn't wipe anything out, just prevents use for a few minutes.

I may have a faulty unit or it's some of the non-Amazon books I'm reading (Gutenberg mostly so they should be malware free but who knows). It's not enough to return the item since Amazon tends to replace brand new purchases with refurbished ones.

If I had but one suggestion for Amazon, it would be to build in a circuit that would allow you to plug a device into the USB port that would have two buttons on a pod and on a longish cord that would let you remotely turn pages. It would be really helpful in the gym while on the cardio equipment like an AMT. You could attach the pod to the handles of the AMT and just tap the page turn button to read.",4.0

236,"I wish I could give the 6.8” Kindle Paperwhite (11th gen 2021) 5 stars. It’s a beautiful, snappy device with a bright, clear large screen. Unfortunately, poor quality control makes this almost perfect device, not so perfect.

Purchased: 27 November 2021
Review written: 30 November 2021

1. Responsiveness
Screen is very responsive and snappy. There’s not much load time when scrolling, selecting, or page turning.

2. Software
Nice user interface. Very easy to use, especially to transfer over library books. There were some issues when opened out of the box, but a reset fixed the issues.

3. Battery/charge
USB-C may be a winner for some. I have no opinion.

4. Quality Control
Kindle is known for having hit or miss quality control. The new 2021 Paperwhite is no different. For me, my Paperwhite has tiny pinhole light also known as a dead pixel. E-readers are prone to this issue so it’s not a surprise, BUT a defect is a defect regardless. Quality control should have found this issue so it doesn’t fall into the hands of customers.

The pinhole is negligible but it is annoying when my eyes stray towards the small light hole. Plus, I paid for a defect-free new device.

5. Amazon Customer Service
Amazon online CS used to be unparallel, second to none. I contacted Amazon online CS about the pinhole light and I was willing to send pictures of the issue. I expected to be sent a new replacement device. Some unlucky customers have to go through 2-3 devices before they find a “perfect” device free of defects/issues. I went into buying the Kindle knowing this.

The best Amazon online CS could offer was to replace my defected device with a certified refurbished device delivered 2-3 days. I asked if a new device could be sent out, CS said no. I asked if I could exchange for another device in store, Amazon CS said no.

I called the Amazon store and the supervisor told me that I can return my device and buy a new device. They will do a price adjustment for me so I pay the same price as I did during Thanksgiving weekend. That was a nice offer… except it makes the process for a new device inconvenient.

Anyhoo, approach Kindle with some caution. It’s not a flawless device. It has the potential to be, though. I’m going to try to ignore the dead pixel as I read before I get a chance to return it for a (hopefully) defect free device.

UPDATED REVIEW - January 6, 2022

I returned the defective Kindle unit at the Amazon 4Star and purchased a new Kindle unit. The Amazon employee did a price adjustment for me so it matched sale price from my original purchase. Right from the box, the new Kindle unit has a very small black dot at the top right of the screen - very minor cosmetic issue. Another dead pixel. This defect is not noticeable compare to the white light spot (pinhole light/dead pixel(s) as the returned Kindle unit.

I expected this. A few lucky Kindle users get Kindles with flawless screens. Some customers have to return/exchange 3-4x to get a perfect unit. Since the cosmetic issue is so minuscule, I accept it. The new unit has an almost perfect screen.

Customer service at the Amazon 4Star store is above average.",4.0

238,"The good points:
1) The adjustable warm light makes reading very pleasant.
2) Battery life is pretty good, but not as good as claimed. A day's reading will drain between 15 to 20%
of the charge.
3) The weight is very light.
The bad points:
1) The VERY sensitive power button is on the bottom, so propping the reader on any surface usually puts
the device in standby mode, and using a stand is awkward.
2) The charging port is also on the bottom, so it cannot be charged on a stand.
3) The touch screen is very sensitive when turning pages, and if touched wrong, it will propel you ahead
several pages.
4) The touch screen when navigating is not very responsive; sometimes requiring multiple taps to move.
5) There are no device margins on the sides (unlike the Fire), so if you try to hold it like a book, your
thumb will activate the touch screen. You can only hold it by the bottom margin.
The bottom line is that the bad features far outweigh the good features, and the overall reading
experience is poor.
The Fire 8"" HD is a far better choice than the Kindle Paperwhite.",4.0
239,"This is my second e-ink device, after my B&N Nook. Having used it for about a month, I can state that the ergonomics of the Kindle are a definite letdown from those on the nook. The device has a flat back and very tiny bezels, which makes it difficult to hold anywhere except the bottom. Which is where the power/lock button is located! As a result, I have on countless occasions now accidentally locked the device just by readjusting my grip. I'm also not a fan of having no physical page turn buttons, since that requires awkwardly reaching over with my thumb, or using my other hand.

The backlight is fine, although the warm colour is very yellow, and not orange, which bothers me enough that I keep the light off, choosing instead to use a bedside lamp with the appropriate colour temperature.

Page turns have a noticeable flicker, which is a bit bothersome, but turning on page turn animations, while slowing down the actual page turn speeds makes the experience much more pleasant and helped me read faster.

The best reason to go with a Kindle instead of other options like the B&N Nook or the Kobo is the availability of Prime Reading, which has offered me a decent collection of books with my Prime membership. I don't buy ebooks with DRMs, so that rules out using the Kindle store. I was able to quickly load up my ebook library of DRM-free ebooks from HumbleBundle and other sources using Calibre.

My Nook had a simple option to require a password for any purchases. However, the Kindle doesn't have such an option. The best solution I could find was to enable parental controls and set a pin to access the online store.",4.0

Now that I’m in my late 20s, I want for myself to read more, and because I’m so attached to electronic screens, I thought the best solution was to invest in a kindle. I prefer to read in the dark before bed so this does wonders compared to the physical paper book and little lamp light.

258,I really like this kindle! It’s my first one and I feel like I want to read off of it so much more just because it’s so convenient. I also purchased the strapsicles to go with it so it could allow me to have multiple holding positions that are comfortable. So far I have no issues with it and the battery life is phenomenal.

259,"Edit: I noticed my Kindle had a dead pixel at the bottom. I exchanged it at the Best Buy I bought my 1st one without any issues and now my screen is flawless.

Upgraded from a Paperwhite 7th gen. The warm light is a game changer. It's so much easier on my eyes with the larger screen too. I was gunning for the signature for the storage but Best Buy didn't have them in stock. I find 8gb is plenty for me as I just keep lots books and maybe 2 to 3 audiobooks on it. Unless you have a crazy library that you always want downloaded, 8gb is more than adequate. I find the wireless charging not needed since the battery lasts long anyway and keeping a fully charged device on the wireless charging stand isn't good for the battery (although it would look aesthetic on my nightstand lol).

That does come with a few drawbacks - when searching for new books the black and white display and the basic touchscreen (scrolling is not very smooth) make it a little hard. It might be easier to search for new books on another device and then put them on the kindle (which syncs nicely). The touch screen works totally fine for the reading functions like page-turning and overall I appreciate that there are no flashy, colorful, unnecessary features. Well worth the price so far for me!

273,"I am having a bit of buyer's remorse with this. I had been thinking of getting a new Kindle just because mine was old but then I started having connection problems. I was on chat & the phone for HOURS & no one could figure out what the problem was. Finally I was told it was just old, it hadn't even updated in nearly a year, & I probably should just get a new one which I did since I'd been thinking about it anyway. When it arrived it wouldn't connect either. I brought them both to the library & both connected. It turned out it was something weird w/ my ISP not the Kindle at all. But I decided to keep the new one & gave the old one away. Now I wish I hadn't. This one is a bit bigger, is more square & feels a bit awkward to hold since I don't want to bend back the cover like I did on my old one which cracked it along the fold. I wish the settings we could choose from were all in one place rather than scattered around. I am not real tech savvy & think they are hard to find. I don't care what other people highlight in books & I for sure don't know why anything is highlighted in a novel but I looked all over & couldn't find how to turn that off. I contacted chat & they eventually told me it was on the font Aa page under 'more'. I have trouble getting to the things I want & don't know how to get back to a page. I just got a new book & it didn't even go to the Kindle even tho that's what I selected. I had to get it from my Amazon page w/ all my books on it. The ones that were new on the old Kindle are not labeled as such on that page so now I don't know what I haven't read & what have only been removed from the device. I get books on special offer so sometimes I have them quite a while before I get to them. I really hate that warm, amber light! I turned it on accidentally then it took a bit to find out to turn it off but I was able to lower it to zero so that shouldn't be a problem any more. I suppose it's just a matter of getting used to where things are, like learning a new comp, but that isn't a pleasant process. I do think it could be a little more user friendly for those of us who are technologically challenged. I also wish there was a general tech support category for chat. I've had to click on something that didn't apply to get help but everyone I have talked to has been fantastic. I hope I cheer up about it now that I have it but right now I really miss my old one.",5.0

275,"So far, I love this kindle. I was on a budget and it was used, but was in pristine condition. Very happy with amazon warehouse.

The images have great definition. They’re black and white only. Wish there was color, but I enjoy the illustrations or pictures. Detailed.

The ability for background lighting adjustments really is amazing. My eyes never strain and I can make the pages the same color as a book. Only difference is when it’s dark it’s lit! Perfect while waiting to tuck my little girl in bed while she falls asleep.

The touch sensitivity is great. Navigating on this kindle required me to google a little to figure things out, but it’s mostly easy. The storage seems good at 8gb. I can delete things I read if needed. I like being able to carry a lot of books and magazines in one device. I find I read and get tired and jump around other books or magazine I have downloaded.

The battery is great. When using Wi-Fi it will probably last 8 days. Off Wi-Fi they say it could last many weeks. It’s easy to charge.

Overall I feel I’m going to read a lot more using this kindle. I was addicted to my phone. I like technology. Now I have fun with this instead, yet it’s a better and healthier addiction. It’s like watching tv, only for my mind. Thanks Amazon for this. I can even read in the bath or at the ocean without worry of dropping it since it’s pretty waterproof.

If you like your phone, you’ll like this. It’s bigger than your phone. A perfect size. It’s like a book and you can read anytime and anywhere. Kindle unlimited opens up lots of magazines and books. Same with amazon prime. Or you can just use your library app. I am so happy. Highly recommend.",5.0
276,"I recently purchased an Amazon Kindle e-reader and I am absolutely loving it! The first thing I noticed when I took it out of the box was how lightweight and compact it is - it's incredibly easy to hold in the palm of my hand for extended periods of time.

One of the features I was most excited about was the built-in night light, and I have to say, it does not disappoint. The adjustable light allows me to read comfortably in low light conditions, without straining my eyes or disturbing my partner.

But perhaps the most impressive aspect of the Kindle is the text display. The e-ink screen is crystal clear and the text is crisp and easy to read. I've always struggled with eyestrain when reading for long periods of time on backlit screens, but that has not been an issue with the Kindle. The battery life is also excellent - I can easily go a week or more without needing to charge it.

Overall, I am thrilled with my purchase of the Amazon Kindle e-reader. It's lightweight, easy to hold, and has a beautiful display that makes reading a pleasure. The night light feature and excellent battery life are added bonuses, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for an e-reader.",5.0

278,"I have a first gen kindle that I received as a gift many years ago and it is still working great and battery life is still strong, and I read a lot. But it had no backlight and was hard to read at night. So, I diddled around trying to decide if I should get a new Paperwhite or not. I saw they were on sale, so I went for it. I bought the bundle deal. It came with the Paperwhite, cover, charger & cable. With the cover it does not seem to weigh any more than my old one without a cover.

I have had it a couple of weeks now and I love it. It was so easy to set up and I thought I would have to give up my old kindle if I purchased a new one, but no. Now I have an extra one.

I like that the cover that will shut it down when you close it and I do not have to push a button on the bottom. Reading is easy on the eyes; I have left it on the default. It also can update my Goodreads account.

What I find a slight annoyance is that if I leave the book and it shuts down on its own, I cannot just tap the screen to reopen it. I have to close the cover and re swipe to open. Not a big deal for me, just an extra step, but it is just something to note for someone who does not get the Amazon cover.

When I received it, the battery was at around 70%. I fully charged it and I have been reading on it for two weeks for about 2 hours a day and it is at 73% right now. So, no complaints about battery life. My other kindle I carry around and read at work and it seems to have a slight longer battery life, but it does not have all the extras the Paperwhite has.",5.0

I was worried about losing the tactile experience of turning pages and the convenience of being able to easily mark my place with a bookmark. But after using the Kindle Paperwhite for the past few months, I have to say that I am a convert.

One of the things I love most about the Paperwhite is its compact size and lightweight design. It fits easily in my bag and is perfect for travel, allowing me to carry a whole library's worth of books with me wherever I go. The screen is also a joy to read on - it is clear and crisp, and the adjustable backlight makes it easy to read in any lighting conditions.

In addition to its practical features, the Paperwhite also has a host of convenient features that make reading even more enjoyable. I love being able to highlight passages and take notes, and the dictionary function is a huge help when I come across a word I don't know. The battery life is also impressive - I can go weeks without needing to charge it.

In conclusion, the Kindle Paperwhite is a book lover's dream come true. It is compact, convenient, and packed with features that make reading even more enjoyable. Whether you're an avid reader or just looking for a convenient way to access your favorite books, I highly recommend giving the Paperwhite a try.",5.0

The screen clarity is wonderful even for a person with cataracts, like me. I don't regret the purchase except for the disappointment of it not being any sort of upgrade.",5.0
284,"This review is for the new Kindle Paperwhite 11th Gen (8 GB). First of all, I must say that this Kindle feels great. It might feel a tiny bit heavier than my old Kindle Paperwhite 7th Gen, but this is honestly hardly noticeable.
I love my old PW and just wanted to upgrade to a newer model because of the slightly larger screen, Bluetooth capabilities, and the warm light.

It never occurred to me that I could have any issues with the screen, so imagine my surprise when I turned it on and immediately noticed a dead/stuck pixel on the left upper side of the screen. People on the Internet say this is a manufacturing issue, and there is no way it will disappear on its own. I can see it there, even when the screen is dimly lit. To be honest after a while, I forget it's there and in some cases, the words ""cover"" it up. I don't mind this tiny flaw.
The Kindle feels great. Reading is even more enjoyable now. The ability to control the amount of warm light alone makes this Kindle worth the upgrade.

I think that 8GB is more than enough if your idea is to store books. Now, if you are thinking of downloading audiobooks too, then 8GB are still enough. That is, if you are not planning on downloading hundreds of books at the time... I rely on the cloud to store my books.

It seems that the audiobooks will come from Audible. I don't see (or haven't really looked for) a way to sideload them or use any other store to get them. So, if you're not a prime member or don't have an audible subscription, chances are you won't be using the audio book feature much.

I noticed that if you enable the ""listen"" feature, you cannot read along. I can do this on the Kindle App, and as a non native speaker, I like having this option since I get to check on pronunciation of unknown words.

Overall, I'm super happy with this unnecessary purchase and fully recommend the upgrade to anyone. I got my new Kindle like two days before Prime Day and paid full price for it... Even at full price, I don't regret it.",5.0

303,"I fell for the hype of buying the ""premium"" Kindle Voyage when it was first released. Don't get me wrong, it's an awesome Kindle but was quickly outclassed by the Kindle Oasis and the new, at the time, Kindle Paperwhite. Anyway, I love my Voyage but when I heard about the new Kindle with the bigger screen, I had to have it. It arrived yesterday and I'm really liking it.

First, the things I don't like.

- The Kindle arrived in a soft bubble shipping bag and the Kindle itself comes in a very thin, and for me, crushed, cardboard box. I was afraid the screen was going to be broken but luckily for me, it was fine.

- I don't like the power button being on the bottom. The Voyage has the power button on the back and out of the way. I've pressed the power button on the Paperwhite twice now by accident.

- Another thing I don't like...and don't understand...is that I charged the Paperwhite overnight and it only charged to 99%. My Kindle Voyage will only charge to 98%, even when it was brand new. Is that a thing with Kindles; they don't charge to 100%?

- The Paperwhite was supposed to arrive already tied to my account but it wasn't. It wasn't hard to set up but it didn't transfer my library to the Paperwhite automatically. Should it have? From my PC, I transferred my library to the Paperwhite from the Digital Content management page. That was a pain in the butt because you can only transfer the books 1 page at a time and my library is 34 pages long. And you can't sort the books by whether they had been read or not, so I had to uncheck all the books I had already read so they wouldn't be transferred to the Paperwhite. Not to mention that not all of my read books were listed as being read so I had to sort that out too. It took a long time to transfer my library. Ugh!

Second, the things I do like.

- Everything else!!

- I love the larger screen. The extra screen real estate, compared to my Voyage, is awesome.

- The Paperwhite is a lot faster than the Voyage in navigation, page turns, everything.

- I'm glad it has a USB-C port, which will cut down on the number of cables I have to keep track of.

- So far, I don't miss the physical buttons that the Voyage has...but I've only had the Paperwhite for a day so that may change with more use.

I haven't played around with the lighting yet so I can't speak to that.

My new Paperwhite got 2 software updates yesterday. After the second one it froze and I had to restart it. After that it was fine.

So far, I'm really pleased with the new 2021 Paperwhite and I think it is a great upgrade from my Voyage.",5.0

Thanks Amazon!

One gripe about the kindle brand in general though is that it's a little cumbersome to send non-amazon ebooks/pdf's to it and is more locked down than a pure andriod e-reader and requires a special ""send to kindle"" app or sending books document by email so I'm not sure if I'd add anything ""private"" or ""confidential"" to it but not a deal-breaker considering the great reading experience.

For me, a big positive is the sync between the Kindle and my iPhone 14 meaning that I can continue reading a story on the cell phone when I do not have the Kindle with me.
The negative of this paper white Kindle are the instructions which are poorly written and difficult to follow. I actually had to get help to use even the most basic features.

318,I am a big reader without a ton of space for books. I've been using a Kindle for years and love them. Reading outdoors was a challenge however. With the Paperwhite no sunlight is too bright. I also love dark mode so I can read in bed and my husband can sleep next to me undisturbed. The Paperwhite is worth the extra money. Great purchase!,5.0
319,"From now on I will always buy the kids version of Kindles rather than the standard. There is NO DIFFERENCE in the actual Kindle device for the Kids version or the standard model, and there are several features that make the additional expense worth the extra money.

They are typically $20 more (I paid $10 more because of a sale), but the increased price is more than worth it. It comes with a nice case (there is a plain black one in addition to the kiddie styles), which would be worth the $20 by itself. The other added features are that the warranty is extended from 1 year to 2 and the kids version DOES NOT have Special Offers (which is $20 to remove on the standard Kindle). Instead, it will show the cover of the book you are currently reading, which is nice (you do have to go in to options to set the Kindle to do this. Otherwise it displays a few random book-themed pictures. Either way it does not display special offers.

Please note that it does come with a free year of Amazon's Kids service. That is a subscription, so you have to remember to cancel it or you will face a recurring charge. That's a small ""price"" to pay when you get all the other advantages.",5.0
320,"I lost my last Kindle sadly so I purchased this one. It is very fast. The color options with the display is a nice add-on.

I wish I had a control of sensitivity that would let me adjust the sensitivity settings.",5.0
321,"I've had this kindle for about a week, and so far it's been awesome. The screen is very paper-like, and the device itself is lightweight and easy to hold, even for long periods of time. I purchased my unit in ""Used - Very good"" condition, and it was brand new when I got it. If it weren't for the brown box, I would have assumed this unit to be new.
The biggest problem with this Kindle is the lack of proper ebook format support. You can send .epub files to the device via email, but then they end up on your home screen with absolutely no book covers, and sometimes with formatting issues. From looking around online, the only way to get book covers on files sent to your kindle is to use your computer and a piece of software called calibre. This process isn't hard, but it's just annoying having to plug the thing into my computer to do something that shouldn't have to.
One minor problem is that the front and back get dirty easily. It's very easy to clean the back of the Kindle with a damp cloth, but the front is a different story. You don't really notice it's dirty unless it's under direct light, but it's difficult to clean regardless. It seems that microfiber cloths just sort of spread the fingerprints around, and don't really help.
Overall, I have read more books thanks to this device, and I'm really glad that I purchased it. Worth every penny. Just don't expect to be getting your books from anywhere other than Amazon, unless you want to deal with side-loading (which sucks). Amazon, please fix.
UPDATE: Amazon fixed it! Finally!",5.0

323,"My first package arrived damaged (crazy damaged, it was unbelievable) and a customer representative refused to exchange the item so I couldn’t really tell my experience with the kindle product because it wasn’t functioning properly.

After fighting for a replacement that someone else was kind enough to provide me with we could finally use it and it works pretty well. This was a gift for my dad, he really likes reading and this will reduce the amount of books around the house. He kept mentioning that he wanted one and we finally got him one.

For what I could see it functions properly, it’s easy to use, but I’m unsure as to whether the battery life lasts a lot or not. This is my experience with the product so far.",5.0
324,"I had a kindle reader probably around eight years ago and there has been a vast improvement. The night mode makes reading at night much more pleasant and there is a warmth setting you can toggle as well if you prefer the white pages. I was on the fence about purchasing a kindle since I have and iPhone and iPad I could download ebooks in, but this makes such a big difference! It truly looks like paper and having a dedicated device for reading really improves the focus. The web searching isn’t the best since the loading is a little weird (no scrolling and a flash in between loads), but that’s okay considering all you’re using it for is reading. Charges super fast, and battery drains slow. Definitely worth the buy!",5.0

327,"This is my third kindle. The last one I had was an 8. It lasted for six years and I was pretty happy with it. This is a noticeable upgrade. The ink appears blacker and it is easier to read. I have some visual limitations that require large print but I don’t have to go as large on this model as I did on the 8 which translates to less Page turning and that is nice. I’m also enjoying that it is water resistant so I can read in the bathtub or at the beach without worrying about dropping it. The 11 can be adjusted much brighter than previous models I’ve had, I actually had to soften the light a little bit. Another change I noticed is there’s not actually a frame around the screen anymore. There is a black border around the white screen but it’s all one smooth continuous surface. This makes it easier to keep it clean and free of stray hair that could get stuck under the edges. The screen is also considerably larger even though the entire device is not much larger. It does seem to be slightly more awkward to hold than the 8. It does not balance in one hand quite the same way and is requiring a little bit of adjustment. At 16 GB this kindle has a lot of memory. There was only $5 difference for double the memory so I went ahead. Overall I think it is a very nice upgrade. For me to upgrade from an 8 to an 11 was well worth it.",5.0

332,"My 1st Kindle was a gift from my son - Keyboard style; ordered the 2nd, a Paperwhite because my husband complained about the light at night. This nice reader fell off my lap, landing face down, and the screen was toast. Traded it in for #3 which was a glitchy machine from the get-go. Decided to get the 4th on Cyber Monday.

I would have been much happier with a duplicate that worked. Instead, the new Kindle is bigger and nearly an ounce heavier. The edge that you hold is much narrower, so it's easy to paginate accidentally. Okay, that makes the screen a little bigger, but it didn't need it. The adjustable, warm light is a non-starter. It actually makes the screen darker and duller.

Amazon, you had a nice design; why did you have to go mess with it? If it ain't broke, don't fix it!",4.0

335,"This is my fourth Kindle. Third Paperwhite. First review. This 2022 version is not my favorite. It works and you can customize the light temperature now. The smooth screen with no bezel is nice, same as the Voyage version but not really noticeable while reading. The overall size is just a little too big to comfortably hold in one hand for a long period of time, especially while reading at night while lying down. There is a slightly longer but annoying delay in the device waking up and the light temperature settings having to activate at start up each time are also just intrusive enough to be annoying. The button to activate or turn off is poorly located, as I've accidentally turned it off multiple times while reading. Never did that on any other Kindle. The Voyage was may favorite for size and formatting. Unfortunately the performance started to lag after 4 years so I thought I was upgrading to this 2022 version. It does not feel like an upgrade though. I wish I had not traded in in my Voyage now and I would return the 2022 Kindle.",4.0

Bought it back in later part of October or early November. Since I had a Kindle paperwhite and the Kindle Fire tablet, the charging cords do not fit the new one.

344,"I purchased my first Amazon Kindle Paperwhite in this bundle deal. I did not need the extra charging block but it's essentially free when purchased with the bundle, so why not?

This is my first experience with any Amazon Kindle. I have recently taken up reading again and was beginning to accumulate a collection of physical books so I opted to go paperless instead. I chose this Kindle Paperwhite (8 GB) with 6.8"" display and adjustable warm light, Ad-Supported; along with the Kindle Paperwhite Fabric Cover (11th Generation-2021) in Deep Sea Blue.

I read in the evenings while laying in bed with my head and shoulders slightly propped up on a pillow. I have the brightness turned all the way down on the Kindle and the adjustable warm light to almost as ""yellow"" as it will go. I also wear blue-light blocking glasses. I have NOT noticed any negative impacts on my eyes or sleep schedule due to the light from reading on this Kindle. The overall Kindle and case together are very lightweight and easy to use. The Kindle screen automatically turns off/on when the case opens/closes. My hands, wrists, arms do not ache or get tired when reading for ~30+ minutes.

The battery life so far is beyond exceptional. When I first received my Kindle, I fully charged it and set it aside for 2 MONTHS while I finished reading the remaining physical books I had already purchased. When I picked up the Kindle, after it had been sitting for 2 months, the battery was still at 80%.

I am still learning the little tricks and settings within the Kindle as far as turning off page numbers, percent complete, estimated times, and overall page layout, font, size, etc. I am still toying with the highlighting and other reference/resource features. But overall, the functionality is very intuitive. I have NOT needed to Google any instructions on how to change something yet... I originally contemplated spending the extra money for the version without ads but decided against it, which now I would recommend. The Ads don't bother me at all and only seem to appear on the lock screen.

I thought I would miss physical books and put off buying a Kindle for far too long. This Kindle is so much more convenient, light weight, travels easy, and you don't get distracted with notifications (as you might with a ""regular"" tablet). I would highly recommend a Kindle to any avid reader.",5.0

355,"I have an 11 year old Kindle 3 with Keyboard that is still working perfectly. I decided to trade it in on Prime Day for the Paperwhite to test out the new features. Big mistake.

One of the biggest differences is supposed to be the improved screen resolution. That might be the case for illustrations, magazines, or comics, but I don’t use a Kindle tor that. I could not see any significant improvement when it came to books. One nice addition is the lighting range where you can go from the brightest bright to a reverse darkness with white lettering on a black screen for late night reading. I will miss that but the old black lettering on a grey screen has always been a good middle ground for me. The Paperwhite screen is also bigger for fewer page turns and that was nice but it also shrunk the border bezels which caused other problems. But page turns were a mess.

A light tap on the right side of the screen would often jump ahead two pages and the same could happen going back. It happened enough that I couldn’t trust I was on the correct page. Two times a single tap advanced close to 40 pages. There is an option to turn off the touchscreen and just swipe to advance pages but when I did that the screen would freeze up and not respond to swipes. Well this is an enjoyable way to read.

Regarding the thinner bezels: if you have large hands, reading can be a bit like whack-a-mole. If you are holding it with one hand, which I do most of the time, it is easy to inadvertently brush the screen which results is a page turn you didn’t want. At that point you just feel lucky if it only advanced a single page. My old Kindle 3 is a bit larger and a few ounces heavier but I find it much more comfortable to hold in one hand, especially with the page buttons. The Paperwhite really needs a screen sensitivity option.

So I decided to return the Paperwhite and keep my old Kindle. The battery will eventually stop working but I can replace that for $15.00. So I deregister the Paperwhite for shipment and now it would not power off. I tried everything short of a hammer. After wasting a half hour I called Amazon for assistance as I didn’t want to pack a powered device and at this point I knew it was not going to turn itself off. The rep was great and it still took 75 minutes on the phone to shut it off. At one point I asked the rep if I could bash it to death with a hammer and use our recorded call as justification for the exchange. Or drive a stake through its Kindle heart. I believe she gave it serious consideration.

There were some other nice menu options but who cares if reading a book is so dam frustrating. I could have exchanged it for another one but in those cases Amazon may replace it with a returned/refurbished item. Not a new one. I know the vast majority of people are very satisfied with the Paperwhite but they don’t know how great the Kindle 3 still is, even with the physical keyboard that takes forever to enter anything.",5.0

365,"This is by far the best Kindle Paperwhite of the many that I've tried. I love everything about it: the size, the weight, the ease of use, and I especially love the adjustable warm light. The warm light is so much easier on my eyes. It does not keep me from falling asleep at night when I'm reading in bed, and the warm light is much better for your skin. I recently read a news article about a scientific study on the dangers of blue light on the skin. Apparently, blue light can be as damaging as sunlight. Yikes! No more blue light screens for me!

I also purchased a Fintie Stand Case for 6.8"" Kindle Paperwhite (11th Generation-2021). Together, they make this product perfect. I noticed a couple of reviews on here complaining about the on/off button being at the bottom of this Kindle Paperwhite, which renders it unfit to set on an exercise bike or treadmill stand in order to read, hands free, while exercising. But with the Paperwhite enclosed in the Fintie Stand Case, I can fold it open, set it in front of me on my exercise bike, and bike for miles while reading, with no problems.

I have been an avid reader since I was in the second grade, more than half a century ago. This Kindle Paperwhite is my favorite way to read. Adjustable light, adjustable print type and size, and you can hold an entire library of books in just one hand. What's not to love!",5.0
366,"So first off, this is my first e-reader in over a decade. I decided to get this Kindle (2021) over the 2022 just solely due to the screen being flush with the bezels, and I picked it over the Oasis because of USB-C.
I've had the kindle for a month now, and when it arrived, the first thing that got me was that I thought the screen had a massive sticker on it, low and behold it was just the screen. The amount of detail you get from the e-ink display is absolutely amazing, something I thought that would be near impossible coming from a decade of not using one.
The screen is black and white however you get enough detail on book covers that you can still see the colour on it had you've seen the cover before.
The quality of the device feels amazing, so good I had to get a case alongside to try to preserve as much as I can as I plan on using it for the next few years.
The e-ink refresh rate and the bezel size, are both fantastic.

The only con I have with the Kindle is the placement of the power button, I tend to hold the tablets bottom with my pinky, which is fine with my left hand, but sometimes I hit the bottom with the right hand. However, with the price, to quality, to display, to the placement of the button ratio, it isn't stopping me from replacing this tablet for a few years.",5.0
367,"My first Kindle was the original one with the keyboard. Loved it. It was easy to sort through my library, access books,& read them. My next Kindle was an HD Fire. Loved, loved it, & still use it. Easy to find items on the carousel & in the library & it could use a system voice to read a loud for the times I want to hear a book. That doesn’t happen often enough to subscribe to Audible. Great screen colors, clarity, & controls. The only drawback was using it in bright light. So I finally gave in & bought a Paperwhite. The Controls are a pain to find and use. I do like the charger as I have quite a few devices that use the same one. The text is easy to read but the text layout & font choices are severely limited. It cannot read a loud so I end up using my public library app, Libby, to get audio ebooks. My major gripe with the Paperwhite is the library. It is a mess to sort through. Very difficult to find items and scrolling is a horror. I end up going to the Kindle app on my phone or on my Fire to find a book in my library & then open it on my Paperwhite. The Paperwhite is a neat, compact device with some flaws in its design. If you read a lot in bright light I recommend it. If not, buy a Fire.",5.0

Now, I know that the Kindle Fire and the Paperwhite are two completely different devices, designed for different purposes, and most likely different target audiences, but my god this new device is slow for today's standards!

I understand that it is designed to be as simplistic as possible, for the simple purpose of just reading eBooks and nothing else, but come on, it is 2022 (about to be 2023). Kindle is in its 11th generation and the Paperwhite is in its 5th iteration, there's no excuse for it to be this slow. The scrolling in the home page is just horrible, the screen flashes weirdly when scrolling up or down, and the album covers seem to superimpose each other when you switch from one page to the next. You can't do a continuous scroll either, when you swipe up or down it moves one whole page and then you have to lift you finger off the screen to continue to scroll another page, lift finder again, and... you get the idea. The album covers are low resolution, for obvious reasons, and when you move from page to page everything loads up slowly. I know it's not a defect because I did a hard reset and made sure I had the latest firmware, the device was designed this way and it's honestly annoying. It is beyond my comprehension why 10 years after its initial release, the newest Paperwhite has the look and feel of an Apple Lisa II text document from the 1980s.

I've always loved reading eBooks, and since my original Kindle Fire HD died I've mainly used the Kindle app on my laptop and the app in a 7-year old Samsung Galaxy S7, which is ironically still faster than the Paperwhite. I know most people love this version of the Kindle, but I just can't let the lack of progress slide, so I went ahead and returned it. Now that I have a Google Pixel 7 I'll just stick to the mobile Kindle app.",5.0

388,"I love almost everything about this Kindle. It is priced right (definitely go for the 16 GB over the 8 GB for $10 more), feels snappy and responsive, has tremendous battery life, and a screen that does not make my eyes feel tired even after long reading sessions. The size feels just right as well, not too big or too small. Not to mention, the Kindle's library is just about unrivaled. I don't think I have ever run into a scenario where the library was missing a book I wanted. It also has access to audiobooks through Audible which is perfect for times when I would rather listen to an audiobook.

However, there is one main drawback which led to me rating this 4 stars instead of 5: the lack of an SD card slot. Storage is cheap and 16 GB as a maximum storage size in 2022 just feels bad. You'll have plenty of room for regular books, but if you start loading up on audiobooks or comics/manga, you can quickly start chewing through that storage.",5.0
389,"I didn’t think I would ever like a Kindle because I like “real” books but my eyes are not what they used to be now that I’m in my mid forties. It’s hard to see books when I work out. I really love this kindle because now I can see the pages again. It’s awesome because I always have my “book” on me too. I’ve read 3 books in the short time I’ve had this. I love it so much, and the convenience of it will keep me reading for years to come. If you’re trying to compare this to the Kindle app, the differences are no interruptions with the Kindle vs the app. No blue light with the candle and best of all the screen is much bigger so you can read more on one page. Highly recommend.",5.0
390,"I went the cheap route with my original Kindle. I didn’t use it much because it wasn’t backlit. My reading went way down. I finally pulled the trigger on this one and LOVE it!

393,"I bought the All New 2022 and the 2023 Kindle Paperwhite. After switching back and forth a few times, I preferred the less expensive 2022. It was smaller, lighter, and easier to hold. My biggest disappointment was the dark mode. It isn't really black. It's a dark charcoal and the letters aren't really white. They're a light sand color. I found it harder to read at night than the dark mode in the Kindle app on my phone. When you try to brighten the font in the dark mode, the charcoal color gets brighter at the same time. I tried the amber color, but I didn't like it. Both new Kindles aren't significantly better for reading than my older 2025 Kindle. The audiobook feature sounds nice, but since I'm never without my phone when I'm reading my Kindle, it's just as easy to sync with my phone for the audio mode.",5.0

I knew when I bought it that there’d be ads on the Lock Screen. But good God, 1/2 naked men was NOT was I was expecting every time I pull out my kindle to read at my desk on my lunch break. Embarrassing! I do not like the fact that the ads aren’t customizable at all. These aren’t appropriate ads or book recommendations for kids either! I called customer service and they said the only option is to remove the ads by paying $20, or rather repaying the discount given at the time I purchased the device. I think that’s absolutely ridiculous. Amazon is usually so much more in tune with its customer base, but they’re off the mark on this one. Do better Amazon.",5.0

I read a lot! But the battery lasts and lasts! I am careful to only have the light, if I need it at all, as bright as I really need. Often no light is just right!! I don’t like to wait for things, doctors, husbands, children, car problems. So I never leave home without it!!",5.0

400,"My old kindle was the keyboard, and I love my kindle I just would get into issues where I would read so late in the night and I had to have a light. It would wake my husband. So I wanted the illuminated screen. For me I go dark mode. I prefer it black with white lettering. It is still illuminated but not so much that it is too bright. I have found it easy to maneuver around in it and my books are great. I like I can just tap screen with my thumb too. Very easy reading! I love it so much and I am glad I finally switched! I sat on it a long time trying to decide!

What I also love is it connects to amazon kids too for my kids reading books!!!

I find the response time is perfect for me, and again easy to use. Very happy I got it.

My only thing is there was one small pixel out and I was trying to decide what to do about that. But it isn't anywhere that bothers me too much. So I just went with it. Love it!

And I love the old one too, I just like that this has the illuminated screen and touch.

What it doesn't do that your free iPhone/Android kindle app does is simply a deal breaker for anyone alive today who's brain is rendered absolutely useless by TikTok and other short attention span stimuli. This feature is called immersive reading. And, it's the only way I have been able to ween myself off of my iPhone addiction.

I was gifted my kindle for Father's Day. It was a lovely gift. I downloaded a ton of books. I was so excited to read in the pool. I read for exactly 13 milliseconds before I was distracted. I sat by the pool and read for another 23 milliseconds before I picked up my iPhone and scrolled through TikTok for the next consecutive 4 hours.

I then found, what I learned to call, immersive reading by searching for ""can audible read my kindle books to me"". Immersive reading is absolutely fantastic. It reads the book to you and highlights as it's reading. You're reading along as the audio keeps you focused. I have plowed through 400 and 700 page books in days like I was back in middle school. This can't be my same brain....

I have abandoned my kindle, for now, to use immersive reading on my iPad and iPhone. I hope to return a recovered iPhone addict one day. But, I would also return should a software update bring this feature to the kindle paperwhite. I do not think I would buy a newer/other kindle model to get this feature. It's just to easy to use the IPhone/iPad app for no extra cost..",5.0

407,"My first Kindle was a second gen with they keyboard. I am not new to Kindle. I've owned several at this point. The last one(s) I bought were Kindle Voyage versions. Both of which I actually bought as refurbs. One last me me 6 years. The other I've only had for a year or so. Unfortunately both are starting to have issues. I've replaced the battery in one, which was a bit of a pain but doable. Since both are probably not going to last much longer I decided to suck it up and look at a new one.

I'll be honest, the PW doesn't impress me. At all.

Cons:
1. It's bigger than my Voyage. It doesn't seem like it should make much of a difference, but it does.
2. It's also heavier.
3. Unfortunately I hate the touch screen as much as I thought I would. If I want to advance a page, I don't want to only have to hit the right side of the screen. If both my hands aren't free, or I have it positioned a certain way, then I either can't forward the page or I have to reach over it for every page turn. If we have to do a touch screen (BRING BACK REAL BUTTONS AMAZON!!! NOT THAT OASIS BS BUT AT THE VERY LEAST THE PAGE TURNS LIKE THE VOYAGE HAS), then why can't it be set up like the voyage and have the top half of the screen go backwards and the bottom go forward? At least then you could touch it on either side to move it forward. I'd actually give it another star for this.
4. Because it's a touch screen and you HAVE to touch it to do ANYTHING, there's fingerprints. So many fingerprints. I'm going to have to wipe the screen off constantly just to make it readable.
5. The power button on the bottom is annoying. Why not put it back on the back like the Voyage (And other models before it)? It's so easy to hit there.
6. Why is it when I hit the power button it has to boot up THEN I have to swipe it to bring it up? So many steps. Stop making the Kindle something it isn't. I only want an Ereader. That's it. I don't need another tablet, phone or other electronic device. (Scribe anyone?)

Pros/draw?
The text is crisp. Not sure that it's any better than what I have already.
They have finally decided to charge with USB-C. It's about time.

In the end the special features the PW comes with: waterproof, warm light, etc don't mean anything to me. TBH had they not been so close in price thanks to the holiday sale, I'd have bought the Kindle basic instead. The Oasis has so many complaints about the battery life, and frankly the idiotic buttons are a total run off, that I don't want to go there. I plan on finishing the book I started on the PW, then I plan to send it back. I'll have to limp my Voyage thru a little longer I guess. And hope like hell Amazon will come out with a Kindle that has basic buttons again. Sadly there are many of us out there who keep asking for buttons but Amazon continues to ignore us. I guess if there isn't a viable option when the Voyage died, I'll have to look into a different reader in general.",5.0
408,"I was shopping around for an e-reader and was debating between the new Kobo Clara 2E and this newer version of the PaperWhite.

They are both great e-readers but ultimately depends what you are looking for mostly in size, contrast and clarity. The two readers are both very similar in features.

While the look and display of the PW was stunning I found myself drawn to the KC2E as it had a smaller footprint and when comparing the words on the page found the Kobo to be sharper which is very important to me when reading. The PW is much much brighter than the KC2E but it's display does reflect light a lot more when compared to the KC2E.

The material quality of the e-readers is also different. The Kobo feels cheaper while the PW definitely feels premium.

I chose to go with the KC2E, it ultimately comes down to your preferences as they both share the same features.",5.0
409,Like the new Kindle except for othing ...it skips pages!!!! I swipe a page and it goes 5 to 20 pages. Hard to read when it does that. Have read that I am not alone in this.

412,"This is an initial impressions review. I’ll come back to update if opinions change.

The Kindle arrived within a day which is appreciated. I got a Kindle because I’ve been reading on my iPad through the Kindle app and was looking to consolidate. The iPad was used only for reading and I didn’t need it for anything else. The Kindle lags compared to the iPad. I’ve also had it freeze on me a couple of times. A couple of time in 24 hours is not promising! I like that the Kindle is compact and light. Easy to throw in my purse and take anywhere. I also like that you can read it anywhere at any time of day even with all of the lights off. I fully charged the device the day I received it (yesterday) and today it is down to 90% battery life. I have been downloading and playing with the features so maybe that is why but at this rate it will not last 10 weeks on a single charge as advertised. I thought it was a bit cheap of Amazon not to include a wall plug for the charger cable. I have some Apple wall chargers flying around and those seem to work fine, but if you don’t, this aspect might be annoying to you. It takes a little while to figure out how to navigate around because there are literally no instructions. That’s fine for me, I don’t read instructions, but keep this in mind if you are gifting this to someone that is not tech savvy. I had to Google how to get back to my home page after reading my book because I just could not figure it out (tap the top of the Kindle screen for options). I like that you can browse the Kindle store directly from the device and make purchases. I don’t think I was able to do that on the Kindle app on my iPad. Am I still glad I bought a Kindle? I think so. Time will tell if the freezing issues and lag time when scrolling cause too much frustration.",5.0

This e-reader makes it convenient to purchase or borrow any title you could think of and have it delivered instantly without the hassle of waiting for it. I personally like to read several books at once so with my Kindle I can have multiple books with me and don’t have to carry a heavy load around.

This went south quickly as I realized all the apps and doodads only amounted to distractions when it comes to reading. Luckily, I took advantage of the fall sales, and now the new 11th gen Paperwhite is in my hands.

Compared to the gen 5, it is bigger but lighter by 30 grams with comparable (faux) leather cases on both. This is immediately appreciated, as I could feel the difference in my hands during long(er) reading sessions.

Improvements to the app and hardware, while numerous, are to be expected for something in its 11th iteration. Coming from the ancient 5th gen, I really appreciate the auto warm light, dark mode, and the larger/lighter form factor. I haven't spent enough time on the device to form moans and niggles yet, but we shall see. I hope this one will last me another 10 years like the previous one did.",5.0

I love having a separate device for reading so I can ignore all the notifications I would get on my phone or on a tablet/iPad. 8GB is plenty of memory for me as I only download a series at a time and remove the download once I finish a book. The only complaint I would have is the touch screen responsiveness. It’s a little slow in comparison to a cell phone or tablet but this isn’t super important to me. The 1 year limited warranty is a massive plus as after having my kindle for 2 months, my dog decided to use it as a chew toy, cracking the screen and putting a few holes completely through the device. I assumed it wouldn’t be covered since most warranties only cover device defects but Amazon replaced it! They emailed me a shipping label to send my old one in.

I've already spent many hours with this in my pool and so far so good. I like that the screen is a bit larger than my old one, which is easier on the eyes and less page turns. The battery holds up just as well as my old Paperwhite originally did. I can read 5 or 6 books without having to charge. I didn't think I'd use it, but the nighttime setting is great, automatically adjusting the brightness at a set time of my choosing.

The only negatives I can come up with is that the larger screen means a more narrow space to hold the Kindle, resulting in some accidental page turns. And I wish there were better options for water resistant cases. The one I bought is fine but a bit pricey and not completely water resistant.

Overall, I highly recommend.",4.0

457,"Love my latest kindle!! ❤️❤️ I bought my first kindle paperwhite almost 10 years ago.. since then I have bought about 8-9 devices.. mostly fire tablets as a gift for family.. nephews and nieces. But I stuck to my original kindle paperwhite since I loved the natural feel of the screen. Finally after nearly a decade and slowly down significantly, my kindle paperwhite died. So I started looking for a replacement among all these “generation” of kindle and fire tablets. Finally I found this one during Prime Day, it had great reviews, I got a major discount due to prime day and it was shipped to me in 2 days. The transfer of all my books was super easy from the kindle website. The new one has a lot of space for storing more books. It has audible functionality added too. Last but not the least, it still has the perfect screen for reading.. “paper white” is not false advertising. Now I’m the settings, with brightness you can also adjust warmth. This is especially helpful for me since I read at night in bed. Also if you purchase or borrow books in a series, it puts them all together in serialized format so you can find it in one place in your library.
All in all, I’m very happy with my kindle, I hope it survives my reading habits and lasts a decade like my old one. ❤️❤️",4.0
458,"My Kindle Paperwhite is my favorite product that I materially own at the moment. I love reading and this makes it easier to not only do in the sunlight (it’s like reading paper) but also at night when my husband is sleeping. Being able to dim the light and have the warmth feature is helpful when it comes to nighttime reading so I can drift off to sleep without the impact of blue light. The battery life, thus far, is great. I love the convenience of having all of my books on one piece of technology, and reducing the weight and awkwardness that comes with a full sized book. There is also the plus of being able to link my devices. If I happen to read a book on the Kindle app, it’ll pick up where I left off when I go to read on my Kindle. I’m grateful that this was recommended to me and I that I was able to purchase as a early birthday gift to myself. I do not regret it one bit.",4.0
459,"I recently upgraded from the 10th Gen Kindle Paperwhite to the 11th Gen Kindle Paperwhite and the difference is pretty noticeable, though there are still areas for improvement.

For the most part, reviewing the Kindle for my purposes is pretty much the same as reviewing the function of a physical book. Is it damaged? No. Can it be easily read? Yes. Ok, then it's good to go.

In truth, that's really the two most important things for me when deciding whether or not the Kindle was a good buy, and frankly, I could have stuck with my old Kindle and probably only very seldom got frustrated with it.

One thing I believe Amazon needs to work on with their Kindle is their UI. I understand that this is not a cell phone, a laptop, or a tablet. It's an e-reader, and at the end of the day, most of your time is spent reading books. And for that, the UI is totally fine. But for those times when you're scrolling the store, looking through your library of too many books purchased, or just navigating settings, the UI can be frustratingly laggy and jumpy. The response time is slow, the touchscreen is relatively inconsistent, and the loading time looks like my dial-up computer trying to bring up a black and white webpage in 1998. Again- it's an e-reader and I'm not online shopping on it, but I have to feel that in 2022, this UI could be much smoother and more responsive.

With that said, this is leaps and bounds better than my 10th Gen, which would regularly revert back to the previous screen when trying to load a new one, would flash a new screen 2-3 times before finally allowing me to continue navigating, and would shut down to the main screen intermittently. None of these were deal-breakers, but the 11th Gen is definitely smoother in that regard.

Overall, I love this device. The larger screen from the 10th Gen to the 11th Gen is nice and it doesn't came with a significantly larger package. It's sleek and the screen is a nice adjustable shade when I read. I am very pleased with my purchase.",4.0
460,"So good that my wife took this one and I ""inherited"" the 6.0"" 10th generation Kindle she was using. She really loves the soft lighting for nighttime reading; I don't think I would use that feature. All good as the smaller one fits easily in my back pocket whereas she carries this one in her bag. The USB-C does make it easier to charge as we don't really have that many micro-USB appliances left.",5.0

No other device is as lightweight, no othe device reads like a book, has no glare, or emit blue light. Since I'm not living in an old English estate or a Beverly Hills mansion, I will never have the space to store hard copies of all the books I read on my Kinde. That said, there is one thing that bugs me to no end, and that's the power button on the bottom of the device.

466,"I've had two kindles in my whole life and had to give them up, but I've been looking to get a Kindle for a while. I haven't had the funds to get one and have been content with my phone, until I upgraded phones and was forced to borrow books from KU by computer only.
I chatted with Amazon Kindle support for a solution, so I could borrow books on my phone, but it seemed there was no solution. I didn't have my previous phone, so I couldn't just revert back to that. I tried multiple times to borrow a book, and it would say I borrowed it, but wouldn't show up in my library. Weeks after my chat with Amazon support, I heard there was a Kindle sale, so I bought the latest Paperwhite in hopes I would have access to KU.

I ordered the 8gb version, and was excited to finally have a Kindle again. I received the device a week earlier than expected and immediately after set up, there were
problems left and right. Right away, the device was continuously freezing and glitching. As I was trying to download books, it was deciding to restart itself for a total of three times and reset my download progress each time. Over the course of three days, I finally got all my books downloaded, but yet the device was still freezing and restarting itself.

One day, though, the Kindle was close to being dead, so I decided to preserve the battery and not read until I could get it charged. After putting it on the charger, I went to read and it immediately froze.. again. This time, I couldn't do anything with it. It wasn't dead when I put it on the charger, it was working just fine before, but nothing was happening. I was trying to power it off and on, but it still wasn't working. I Googled the problem and came across directions for a soft restart, which I did. Upon restart, it wouldn't get past the kid and the tree screen, no matter what I did. Eventually I just gave up and left it there for an hour on that screen. It finally got past it, but the device was still glitching and freezing continuously three days later.

Besides those problems, I'm also not impressed with the battery life. After a day of reading with it being fully charged, it drops to 20-30% remaining. It defeats the purpose of having a Kindle, when it has to remain on the charger at all times. Recently it's been more so on the charger than not.

With the amount of problems I've been having, it's strange there's not much out there about them. This is a brand new Kindle, but with the amount of problems I've been having, you'd think it'd be the first generation. I don't know what to do with it. I want a Kindle so I can finally use my KU, but is the multiple problems worth it? I've been thinking a lot about possibly returning it and trying the signature edition, but what if it's the exact same? I don't know what to do. I'm not at all satisfied with this generation and I'm hoping something will change, like an update and it'll be usable again, but that might be too much to hope for at this point.",5.0

I got a case and pop socket as well as a tablet holder to make reading in bed easier and this is by far my favorite purchase in quite some time.

The screen is a lot more crisp, the page turning/refresh is more “snappy”, for this alone it’s worth the upgrade. The size difference may not seem like much, but in person it looks a lot bigger. There was nothing wrong with my 10th Gen but since it was on such a decent sale, I decided “why not?”.

This device is a lifesaver, literally! During a business trip to Costa Rica our yacht accidentally caught on fire which distracted the captain as the ship oversteered, hitting a rock! The yacht capsized and sank into the depths of the ocean along with the entire crew. Luckily I bought the cork cover for my new Kindle and it kept me afloat. After a couple of days swimming, and reading, I safety landed on Coco Island. One day later a fellow crew member made their way to the island as well. Alas, we we’re the only survivors from our humble business vessel. Unlike the water-soaked book my colleague was able to dredge up on the sand my Kindle Paperwhite was in perfect condition. As dusk fell upon the lonely island I watched him struggle to read as I adjusted the built-in light and turned up the warm light option with ease. For the next eight days he read the same book over and over again (what was left of it). Fortunately for me I had my entire library with me and looked forward to days/weeks (?!) of uninterrupted reading time. On one particularly peaceful day I realized that I had quietly transitioned into the role of our business yacht’s sole survivor. Anyhow, the next day a rescue chopper found me and delivered me to safety.

I just received the 11th gen so I don’t know what my battery life would be like but I’m sure it’d be better than the 10th as this one is rated for 10 weeks of battery life. The new 6.8” screen is massive compared to the 6” on the only kindle. I know it doesn’t sound like much of a difference, but the slimmer bezels make the device look and feel thin, yet large.

Nearly the same size screen and better/Almost identical features for a fraction of the price.",5.0
485,"This kindle would be great....but for the disappointing battery life!

NEGATIVES:

Battery: The battery drains on me after a few night's readings, give or take. Amazon's claim that it lasts ""weeks"" without a charge is pure exaggeration. Even if I keep the wifi off, the bluetooth off and the backlighting as dim as practicable, the battery life still disappoints. It's still better than the battery life of a tablet or iPad, but nothing to write home about.

The warm light: I really do not get the point behind this feature. Consequently, I haven't used it much. It doesn't seem to help my eyes at all, one way or another.

POSTIVES:

Screen responsiveness: The screen is very responsive. I had a 10th gen Paperwhite I wanted to hurl through the window every time I attempted to follow a footnote and it instead caused the page to turn. It actually distinguishes between my desire to look up a footnote or highlight something, rather than turn the page. Kindles take a little getting used to as far as the fact that you have to tap something a little longer or shorter to get a desired reaction (dictionary, footnote, page turn, other...) but it is not the nuisance on this one that it was previously.

Waterproof: Oh yeah, it's WATERPROOF! I have yet to deliberately throw it in the bathtub and see what happens, but I like to read in the bath at times and am not keen on electrocuting myself! (Yes, I read in the bath, no judgment please.) Very cool.

Screen size: I love the larger screen. It is just large enough that I can set it on a size 5 text without having to turn pages every five seconds. On my smaller 10th generation I had to set it to size 4 text to get the same effect. The text can be resized or the font changed with great ease and speed.

Weight: Its weight is just fine, very lightweight despite its larger screen size, even with an off brand cover/case.

Located a book a few weeks back that I have a desire to read, it was published around 1920 and is out of print. After finding several used copies at exorbitant prices I decided to look for it for Kindle.
Picking up my Kindle Touch 4th generation from 2012 I quickly discovered that it wouldn’t hold a charge.
Contacted Amazon only to learn they don’t have battery replacement any longer.
I was offered $5 on it as a trade in AND a 20% discount on a new Kindle Fire reader.

494,"I’ve been on the fence for years on buying a kindle. Decided to get one on the recent Prime Day deals. Chose the Paperwhite over the base model due to higher ppi and water resistance.

Never owned a kindle before so not sure but from reading reviews the Paperwhite is supposed to have a more responsive screen. The base model must suck because the Paperwhite is sluggish in 2022 compared to a smartphone or tablet. If my iPad were so slow, I’d throw it against the wall. BUT, as the kindle is purely for reading and nothing else it is totally fine. The delay when pressing a button and getting the desired response is minimal and acceptable for browsing the store and turning pages. That’s really the only negative and it is easily forgivable.

After having tried to read a few books over the years on an iPad, the kindle is a revelation for my eyes. No strain and a very comfortable and pleasant reading experience. Have read for hours on end which was never really possible or enjoyable on an iPad. Love that it is waterproof and can use it at pool or beach.

With the ability to borrow ebooks from my local library, this thing is amazing and well worth the initial investment.

*UPDATE: Okay, my initial excitement has diminished a bit. After using this new Paperwhite for four months I am so disappointed with a BIG FLAW in the design of this which is the power button. I don’t know if it’s in a slightly different place or if it’s just too sensitive, but I inadvertently turn it off way too frequently while reading and it’s become so annoying! This is my fourth Paperwhite and I have never had this problem with the previous models so they definitely changed something, and the question is WHY? Another smaller problem that is not a big deal really but is also different than previous models is the delay in waking. My other Paperwhites upon awakening immediately show the swipe message, but half the time this new one first says it’s waking up, then shows the swipe message. It’s only a couple extra seconds but I just wonder why it’s doing that.

I also still HATE that major update they did that changed everything we were used to, making what used to be simple complicated, adding unnecessary layers making it hard to find anything. After all this time I’m still not used to it and am impatiently waiting for some kind of new ‘smart’ instead of ‘stupid’ update.

The only thing I wish it had was a button on the side to flip the pages because of the way I hold it and my small hands and fingers it hard at times to touch the screen to flip the page.,5.0
509,"I've had Kindle Paperwhite for years, when my cable company upgraded to a new router it no longer supported it so I had to get the new one. It says my Wi-Fi / router speed it's great but this Kindle is so very slow. My old one was never this slow",5.0
510,Bought for my wife and I for Christmas. We both have loved reading on the Kindle. The library of books feels limited in some genres but have not had problems finding books that we enjoy reading. The portability of the kindle is amazing and very comfortable to read on this screen! Battery life is excellent as well.,5.0
511,"I've been reading on my Fire 8HD for years. In the past I've kept an old Fire for reading and used a newer one for games, videos, and everything else, but my ""old"" Fire died a few months back and I'd been trying to decide whether to replace it or get the Paperwhite. I wasn't really sure I needed a Paperwhite. It made no sense to me that my Fire cost less than a Paperwhite, so I wasn't rushing to buy one in spite of the rave reviews. Recently when I wasn't feeling well though, the reflections on the Fire's screen were bothering me and my eyes were getting tired. I'd never really noticed the reflections because I usually read at night in the dark, although it has been a bit of a bother reading on airplanes. That got me thinking that maybe a Paperwhite was something to consider, but the screen looked awfully small and I thought that might be annoying. I decided to wait for Prime Day and get one with the birthday gift cards I knew were coming. I'm so glad I did! The Paperwhite is so light! It's a lot lighter than a book or my Fire. I got a case that has double hand straps so I can hold it comfortably in either hand. It makes reading more enjoyable because I don't get tired of holding it, and I can read in any position. It looks cute on my nightstand in its pretty cover too. I haven't even played with any of the settings, but I'm now a Paperwhite fan.",5.0

513,"This is personally my 3rd Kindle, 1st in the Paperwhite series. This is the 6th Kindle and 3rd Kindle Paperwhite we've had between my wife and I. This Paperwhite 11th Gen is replacing my Kindle Voyage. The Voyage was smaller, lighter, and had a longer battery life (in the beginning). But the Paperwhite 11th Gen is still a better device. On the Paperwhite the screen is more adaptable to light changes and slightly more touch responsive, the device charges faster, and I like the operating system better (software and hardware). I've only had t for a week so I haven't run it through all it's paces yet, but I am excited about the water resistance and potential for Bluetooth connection. I read while floating in a pool or while sitting at the beach so I expect the water resistance feature will come in very handy!

I did have 1 hiccup with the device. Last night the touch screen suddenly stopped responding. I couldn't open the menu or turn the page. I pressed the power button to put it to sleep, waited a few seconds, and then pressed the power button again to wake it back up. I suspect the more advanced software will need to be rebooted occasionally (like a cellphone or computer needs to be rebooted occasionally). This is probably a minor thing, but it could be annoying for someone who's not used to trouble shooting tech issues.",5.0

536,"This is now my 4th Kindle. I owned a non-paperwhite back in 2013, upgraded to an early version Paperwhite, then upgraded again to the 3G paperwhite (which sadly lost 3G feature when the towers were shut down), and now this one.

By far this is the most responsive screen, and the UI software is way better than the previous generation. Much easier to find books (thank you for grouping books in a series!!) - and the touch screen is wonderful with no bezel between screen and case.

The USB-C charging port is a huge perk, as the prior micro-USB would wear over time and be finnicky for charging.

The warm light is a nice feature - my wife doesn't mind when I read in bed as much anymore.

Overall a great upgrade, battery life is amazing, warmlight feature is nice, USB-C and overall screen responsiveness is well worth the upgrade.",4.0
537,"So, I never really thought I would get this version of the kindle because well a kindle isn't really something that you upgrade when the new version comes out. It's something that you upgrade when your old one breaks, and you must upgrade it. Well, I lost my 10th Gen kindle paperwhite at work, so I decided to order this one. I love it. The newer display refreshes just a bit faster than the older one did, and the fact that it's bigger and has smaller bezels really does a lot to make this new kindle feel modern. Another thing is that it now charges via USB C. This is amazing because it means every single one of my portable electronic devices can be charged with my laptop charger.

The one real complaint I have with my new Kindle is the physical size of the device. While I appreciate the larger screen, they wish they could have shrunk the bezels on the older model without actually making the footprint bigger. As a guy who usually wears cargo shorts or cargo pants I could always put my old Kindle in my front pocket. I never had to think about putting it in a bag or make sure that I had a jacket pocket to put it in because it would just fit in my pants or shorts pocket. This is a minor complaint, but if you have an older candle and it fits very exactly into a pocket or bag the new one might not fit as well. Also, Amazon please stop putting the power button on the bottom of the device. Put it on the top of the side, it would be more ergonomic there.",4.0

This could all be us just getting used to the paperwhite. The battery life is incredible. All said and done, this is a nice reader.",4.0
539,I read so much more now that I have a kindle. My only complaint is that it’s not compatible with the Hoopla app (which my library uses). Keeps me from being distracted like when I try to read on my iPad. Also it’s so incredibly lightweight and easy on the eyes.,4.0
540,"This is my fourth kindle and I quite like them in general. The only weird thing with this one is depending on how I hold it, I’ll hit the on off button mid read which I never did with any previous. A minor irritation, but an irritation none the less.",4.0
541,"I never thought I needed a separate device just for reading. I have an iPad Pro and have always just used that for reading books. The Kindle Paperwhite is night and day. It weighs next to nothing, and is so comfortable in the hand and small enough to go in any purse. I'm not sure what sorcery was used to create this thing, but the screen makes the text look EXACTLY like a paperback book. I spend about 6 hours a day reading books or other documents. I have never had any sort of eye strain that I usually get from my phone or ipad due to the warming feature. It is very easy to upload work documents from my computer to the kindle, and of course the kindle library is massive. The only thing that ipad has over kindle is if you are a big annotator/highlighter when you read. Kindle does have this feature, but it is not as simple as it is on an ipad. Don't spend the money on the ad-free version. The only ads present are when you turn the kindle off and an ad pops up as a screensaver. It's not like an ad will randomly pop up when you're reading or anything.

552,"I’ve read about 10 books on this Kindle and have come to this conclusion: the Kindle Paperwhite (PW) is a step down from my Kindle Voyage so I am returning it. If you’ve never used the Voyage, then you will probably love the PW. It is easy to read and the operating system has some nice features that my Voyage does’t. The screen is a slightly larger which most users will see as an advantage. However, it seemed huge to me at first because I was used to a smaller screen.
On the PW, you press the page on the right side to turn to the next page, and press it on the left side to return to the previous page. On the Voyage, you can press either side to move forward or backward, which is great if you hold the Kindle with your left had while reading, as I do. On the PW, when holding it with your left hand, you must tap the screen with your right hand or stretch your thumb across the screen to tap it.
The response to tapping is still slow. As far as I can tell, there is no speed improvements since I bought my Voyager in 2016.
One feature the new PW has is Audible integration. I’m an Audible junkie and enjoy the Whispersync technology. Sometimes I enjoy listening to a book while reading it on the Kindle. Unfortunately, if you use your PW to listen and want to read along, the PW “highlights” the words. It is very distracting and I could find no way to shut it off. Also, if you are listening while reading along, and you flip back a page to glance at something, the narration will jump to that page, which is frustrating. In addition, if you like to listen to Audible and 1.5x, the PW does a terrible job. All in all, I think it is best to avoid using this PW for audible.
I purchased the bundle which included the case. The case is nothing to brag about. My Voyager case folds so the Kindle will be slightly slanted if you sit it on a table to read.
Also, I see no reason to pay extra for additional memory. Kindle books take up very little memory and it is quick and easy to download them when you are connected to WiFi.
If you’ve never used a Kindle or only use to the low end Kindles, this is the Kindle for you. If you’re use to the Voyage, you will be disappointed.",5.0
553,"I dropped my 2014 kindle in September and cracked the screen badly. I loved my kindle - so many books, so easy to take with me, adjustable lighting and font size... so I purchased a Kindle Paperwhite 11th generation with longer battery life and more storage. I've been meaning to figure out how to fix some things in the options menu, and this week tried to figure out how to change the annoying thumbnail representations of book covers that represent each book on my kindle with the more readable list format. Guess what? Amazon has removed the list option from the new versions of the software. I cannot tell which volume of a series I am about to open, because THUMBNAILS ARE NOT READABLE ON KINDLES!!!!! Whoever decided to remove the list option should be fired, if not drawn and quartered, for his or her stupidity. Those of us who use kindles want LISTS not pictures!!! I've been through every menu. I've looked up solutions online. What have I found out? I am not the only person who is angry about what has been done. It would be an easy fix for you guys to just back up and either restore the old version of the software or add the list option to the new software. This makes my kindle almost unusable. I can read a book easily, but I cannot find books that I knew are in my library. This is on you Amazon. FIX IT!!!!",5.0
554,"I specifically bought this item because of the water resistance claim. Don't believe it.

I was reading it in the tub, exactly like they said it could be used. Naturally, it slipped out of my hand and fell in the tub. The screen went nuts with strange characters and the touchscreen wouldn't work. I had read the directions on this possibility and shook what water I could out of it through the charge port on the bottom and then stood it on a towel with the charge port down to let it dry out.

It never came back to life. After a few hours, it was still wet inside with a cloudy layer of water visible on the touch screen. After two days, it had stopped dripping water from inside, but the cloudy water on the screen was still there. After a week I gave up and tried it out.

The touch screen did not work, you couldn't do anything on it at all. A forced reset didn't help ... nothing. Since I had been playing with it trying to get it to work, the return time expired and had to send it in for repair. They sent me a replacement, and I'm using it.

That stuff about a water resistant device that has to be drained of water, the dried is pure hogwash!! How do you drain and dry a device that has a 3/16th inch hole in the bottom for evaporation? You drop these things in water, expect them to die with water on the backside of the inoperable touchscreen and a messed up display.

559,"The flaws are minor compared to the primary benefit—I am able to read much longer before experiencing eye fatigue. The page is easy on the eye—more comfortable than the pages of a book; more comfortable than pages read on the iPad’s shiny surface. In addition, the software is easy to navigate; not too loaded down with features few people would use. You really can read it outside.

UPDATE: After using the device for a time, I've downgraded my initial rating a bit. There are quite a few negatives:
1. The ads are pointless and endless. They appear on the start-up screen and on the home screen (the latter apparently don't go away, even if you pay for ad removal). They only frustrate and distract. And the very reason many people choose a device dedicated to books is to avoid the distractions posed by modern technology.
2. I've repeatedly been sent ads without a swipe option, effectively locking me out of my own device!!! This causes a forced reboot in order to read.
2. The font for the note-taking is tiny. It would be helpful if the note-taking font matched the size of the reading font.
3. Typing notes is a slow process. The keyboard lags as it searches for predictions. I would like to be able to turn the predictive feature off.
4. After highlighting, you must tap the screen to remove the menu. This is okay, except often one highlights, and then taps the side of the screen to advance to the next page. But before one can advance, they must then go back and release the menu. This makes for a lot of unnecessary screen tapping. Can't the device be programmed to realize that, if you're advancing to the next page, you're done with your highlight?",5.0

573,"My new Kindle arrived on release day, and in all aspects except one, I love it. It is zippy, the text is crisp and clear, and the backlighting is wonderful. I’m coming from a 7th Gen Kindle (which has now become my husband’s) so the speed, extra LEDs, and the warm lighting are big improvements for me. I actually love the bigger size, I’ve read 4 books in as many days on it, and I just adore it. That being said, this next part of the review is based purely on the fact that it came with the old software, well the old interface anyway, and the option to update it manually is greyed out. When I contacted customer service (who were RUDE!) they said it is running the current software 5.14 and there are no updates available at this time for the BRAND NEW device. So, is 5.14 supposed to have the old interface? My husband’s 7th Gen Kindle updated to 5.13.7 and has the new interface. So, it would appear that my Kindle is running “newer” software, but it sure does look like the old interface to me (see photo). I’m keeping it because I love it, and with the hopes that there will be an update to fix this obvious software error soon. It really is a GREAT new Kindle otherwise, I just hope they push out an update ASAP, as it appears I’m not the only one experiencing software issues. I will update my review accordingly. The new fabric cover is excellent! It has a great feel to it, and is lightweight. It is more pink than lavender, which is fine by me. I love the fabric texture a lot.

*UPDATE: Customer service reached out to me to let me know that they froze the current software from updating once they discovered that it was causing issues.

Update: it helps to read the user guide because it says I can swipe, & it gives more info on sorting libraries in ""family"" mode) It is too easy to skip pages if you are carrying it from one room to another so just switch it off. I do like when I can display the book I'm reading on front screen (ad free) but it's not really worth the extra $$ to get ad free option. The only ad you ever see is reading recommendations on your front screen when it's turned off. All in all it's a great product.",5.0
576,"Based on some negative reviews I was hesitant to upgrade from my old 6 edition paperwhite but I am glad I did. It is much faster and the perfect size. It was also very easy to set up. The only gripe I have is like Apple you do not get a charger brick. So you have to use your PC or previous brick to charge. And you need a case for it, it is inconvenient to turn on or off using the power button. And sometimes the touch screen is unresponsive or slow to use when navigating some functions. It is fine though when flipping pages.",5.0
577,"My previous Kindle Paperwhite was only holding a charge for a few days and it was looking kind of beat up, so I decided it was time to upgrade. Here are the pros and cons compared to the previous model:

Pros:
* Lightweight
* Larger screen
* Better screen: the older model had dark areas at the top and bottom of the screen
* No stuck pixels: the older model had three stuck pixels that bugged me
* Waterproof (I could care less about this)

Cons:
* The wider form factor makes it more difficult to hold, especially if you have small hands
* The border is now part of the screen, so if you touch it, it will leave smudges
* Because the border is part of the screen, if you touch the left or right border, it will take you back or forward a page. This is the worst thing about this Kindle. I often find myself on the wrong page because I touched the border. I'll have to train myself to keep my fingers off the front of the device. Whether I'll be successful remains to be seen.

Bottom line: I like this Kindle Paperwhite. I would like it more if the designers had made it so touching the black border didn't turn the page. Keep a microfiber cloth handy and try not to touch the border and you'll be ok.",5.0

579,"I was always hesitant to buy a Kindle because I’m one of those people who likes reading from a physical book- turning the pages etc. I finally decided to buy a Kindle during Prime Day because I was tired of having to carry multiple books while traveling and wanted something easy to carry in my purse.

I am SO happy I finally decided to buy it. I love being able to carry it conveniently to read when I have downtime at work, I love looking at the store and all the options of books, and I feel I am reading even more. It’s also nice to have the Kindle app on my phone so if I don’t have the actual device with me, I can read on my phone. My mom also felt the same way I did with the “physical books”, and after I gave her a Kindle for her birthday, she loves it as well! I still enjoy reading from paper books but love my Kindle just as much.",5.0

I didn’t want to look at my phone anymore than I already did, I wanted a bigger screen, not waste my phone battery reading (especially when away from home) and be able to see the screen outside. It fulfills all of those and I’m very happy with my purchase. The battery life is AMAZING! I’ve charged it twice in like 7-8 weeks and I read a lot. It won’t replace the look and smell of an actual book ;) but it is a great substitute. The only thing I don’t like is that for some reason all of my Audible books transferred to it and I will probably never listen to them on this, I hope that doesn’t cause storage issues in the future. Would definitely purchase again!",3.0
586,"I’ve had a Kindle since the second version came out. I thought I’d hate e-readers and refused to buy one until I was on vacation and went through all of the books I’d brought with half my trip left. So I ordered one and it was delivered the next day. I love them.

When my Kindle Voyager (purchased in 2015) finally died, I was happy to get the new one largely due to the water resistant feature. My prior Kindles have all survived accidental drops in the bath tub, but having one that is designed for it is a relief.

This is my best Kindle yet. The warm screen feature that allows me to set automatic changes based on my local sunrise and sunset is great. The screen is even more clear. It weighs less and without measuring it, I think the screen is slightly larger. The basic memory is larger than my old one and I wasn’t even close to using all of that up with the over 1,500 books that I own on it. I remain a devoted Kindle fan.

My one complaint - the new charging cord is different than the old one. Fine, no big deal. I went online to order extra ones since I keep spares in my luggage, briefcase, etc. (I pretty much don’t leave home without my Kindle.) The third-party cords that pop up on Amazon have largely poor reviews. Which begs the question - why can’t I buy the exact cord that Amazon sent along with my new Kindle from Amazon? They are having them manufactured. Everyone needs more than one charging cord for their devices. Amazon makes the wall plug in available, but not the cord.

Come on, this seems like an easy fix.",3.0

This is absolutely the MUST-HAVE for a Kindle. The screen is just a little bit bigger, which makes such a huge difference. The BEST PART about this UPGRADE is the ability to change the warmth of the light. It's not that bad with the white light, but once you are able to change the warmth of it, it is a game changer. The speed at which it changes from page to page is incredible too. I'll be at the bottom of the page, hit for a new page, and by the time it takes my eyes to reach the top of the screen, the new page is already loaded. There is no delay! I absolutely love this upgrade and I recommend it to anyone thinking of buying a kindle for the first time, or for upgrading their current model!",3.0

My kindle bibles, and I have several different kindle bibles, are sometimes very slow to jump from book to book. I just think it could be a better, faster experience. Though I’m grateful to have my paper white for most all my book reading, I think there is a great deal of room for improvement. Navigation needs to be completely redesigned.",3.0

609,"When my 3 yo Paperwhite was lost, I purchased a new one in December. It's a little bigger than the previous one but otherwise very similar EXCEPT for one thing. For some reason, they made the power button larger so that rather than sitting flush with the shell it sticks out. The reason that's an issue is that unlike a phone, the Paperwhite's power button is on the bottom of the unit rather than the sides. If, like me, you put the Kindle on a stand or just prop it up against something while reading, the unit will shut itself down.

What makes this even worse is that in the past if you turned your Kindle off and then turned it right back on, you'd be right back on the same page. With this Kindle, it goes through this long boot-down and boot up process and then it returns you to the Home screen where you have to select your book again and then, presto, the book opens to a page 10 pages back.

I have been using the Kindle app on my tablet. The app is great but my tablet is slow and uncomfortable to hold for long periods of time (arthritis).

What I like:

This device is light as a feather.

It performs quickly.

It is easy to read and customize.

The ads are not intrusive at all. I hadn't intended to buy the ad supported device and didn't know that an ad free device is available. I can easily live with the ads and, who knows, Amazon might even display ads for books I might like

What I'm not crazy about:

Page refreshes are kind of clumsy. Page turns are okay but the dialog boxes cause the screen to go dark for an instant when the box closes. To me this seems rough around the edges.

The screen sort of reminds me of the old liquid crystal displays found on Palm Pilots and similar devices back in the day.

I was hoping to find that the Kindle app and the actual Kindle have the same navigation. They don't.

What I'm hoping for:

Long battery life. I do most of my reading at night so the backlighting will always be on. I'm still fiddling with the brightness setting to find a sweet spot.

621,"Love:
-Temperature adjustment (although this is also available on the Kobo Clara HD)
-I can send most titles from Libby to Kindle from my multiple library accounts, although it takes an extra step
-Dark mode - most comfortable for reading in…darkness

Dislikes:
-I miss the bezeled screen. It’s too easy to accidentally turn a page.
-The screen feels harder to read on than the Clara HD. It seems less matte and requires more eye-straining illumination to read comfortably in the same light as the Clara HD.
-I wish it were smaller. The Clara HD is the perfect size for me and my small hands. Add a flip cover to the Paperwhite and it feels just a bit too unwieldy, heavy, and unbalanced in my hand. I thus prefer reading it “naked,” with a clip on grip, but that requires a larger travel sleeve that is significantly less compact than the Clara HD, which literally fits my jacket or rear pants pocket.
-Ads. Every time I look at them when I go to pick it up, I am filled with disgust. I am unfortunately even more indignant about *paying* to remove that feeling, so here I am.
-Fingerprints. Ew. I am not a dirty person and I swear I wash my hands frequently, but you wouldn’t think that by looking at my Kindle. If it came in white, it would probably be significantly less noticeable.
-Lack of font options. I know I can sideload more, but why must I have to do it to get any kind of variety?

If I could get the Clara HD to sync both my library cards on my overdrive account at the same time, I’d be using that instead of the Paperwhite. It’s a significantly better value for your money, more pocketable, more pleasurable to read on and handle, faster, and if you like free books, easier to use with a *single* library account (in the US). The moment Kobo streamlines Overdrive and you can have more than one library to toggle between, I will definitely be saying goodbye to Kindle, as I own very, very few Kindle titles and borrow most of my books.

Screen Size: the upgrade in screen size is my favorite thing about this device, it makes reading much more pleasurable with fewer pages turns.

I also love the waterproofing. My old Paperwhite did not have this and I love that I don't have to worry about it getting ruined at the pool, or more frequently, carrying to and from the car in a rainstorm.

Is this a great device? Yes, it is a Kindle.

Is this device perfect? Far from it...it's a Kindle. My main beef is the smaller bezel that every tech reviewer seems to go nuts about. I am constantly turning pages on accident because if you even imagine you're holding this thing with your thumb near the edge of the screen, the pages will turn. Amazon should add a feature that creates a user customizable dead zone on the edges so that accidental page turns are a thing of the past. This would rock my world. Or, you know, they could just make the bezels a little wider to make the device easier to handle.

Another thing I cannot stand is the placement of the power button. Just resting the end of the device on a table and tilting it up is another to turn it off. This happens all the time. It also happens just holding the device...this power button would be better suited where it was on my older 2015 Paperwhite or, better yet, on top of the device, out of sight, out of mind.

I am glad to see the direction they have taken this update. However, the OS is still laggy, the bezels and power button, due to the design, are FAR from optimal. I think they need to hand these out to employees during the design phase to do a LOT more testing before settling on the final design.

But, who am I fooling? This device will sell like hotcakes so Amazon basically has no reason to listen to what any of us say. I wanted to give it 3.5 stars, but gave it 3 because these shortcomings do NOT make it a 4-star device.",3.0
631,"I had an earlier generation paperwhite -- I really like that the Kindle generates its own light... no more leaving a light to read by.

This gen 11 screen is much smoother than my old one, and the improved CPU does make it seem more responsive... I liked it in every way.... except for two things:

1) Most important, after about six weeks, the device locked up, and could not be restarted or reset. On the good side, Amazon provided stellar support and is shipping me a replacement.

2) I have many of my books in collections and the last update of the software is HORRIBLE! When I choose to view my collections, you have NO CHOICE but a grid view, and many of the books don't have easily readable titles... I want a list view, but this cannot be done! If I just look at all of the books (no collection view), the form can be selected, but not once I tell it to show the collections. This is TERRIBLE!!!
I hope that they fix this quickly, for I have to resort to searching to find my books now, since many of the covers are not that readable.

I've only had it for a few days so I can't comment on the battery life yet, so far so good. The only flaw I can find is that it doesn't stay connected to my school wifi, which is a little annoying.

I was choosing between the kindle pw5 and kobo libra 2 and bought both devices to test them out. I am going to keep the pw5. Libra 2 is a great device, if I must say the better device. It also has overdrive support. In my case, I use my ereader almost solely for library books so this is a huge plus for me. However, kindle has all the features that I care about and was much cheaper, even though my trade-in promotions didn't come in time for black friday promotion due to some system error. I'm also not the biggest fan of the asymmetrical design of the libra 2 and couldn't care less for physical buttons, and the pw5 feels good in my hands since it's thinner and I can hold it with one hand without feeling like the other side is too heavy. On the other hand, the libra 2 definitely has better contrast and a nicer display. You won't really miss it though with the pw5, which has a great display as well.

Overall, kobo's libra 2 is the better device and I would definitely recommend it over the signature edition. Compared to the regular pw5 though, the lower price of pw5 makes them about equal, and personally the pros of the libra 2 wasn't worth the extra 90 dollars and the cons of pw5 had easy workarounds for me.",5.0
643,"I'm glad up I upgraded to the 2021 Paperwhite from my 2018 Paperwhite. I was on the fence about purchasing this Kindle Paperwhite since 2018 version was perfectly fine and the upgrades seemed so incremental (slightly larger screen; faster processor; warm lighting & better lighting array). All these little changes make for a big difference in reading experience. I'll address all the new features in comparison to the 2018 Paperwhite.

Processor Speed. The processor is fast. There's no delay in turning pages anymore. On the 2018 Paperwhite, there was a millisecond delay in touching the screen and turning the page. There's barely any detectable delay for the 2021 Paperwhite. White this might not sound like it makes a difference, it changes the reading experience a lot. The device feels super responsive and makes the reading experience much more encompassing.

Screen Size. The 2021's 6.8"" screen is only .8"" bigger than the 2018, but that makes for a lot of additional text. When you combine the bigger screen size with the new processor, it makes the reading experience much more immersive.

LEDs. The warm LEDs are a nice touch for nighttime reading. It's an aesthetic preference but if you like warm colored lights, it's nice.

Other miscellaneous things.
- USB C is nice...(microusb's finickiness about being plugged in precisely has always been annoying).
- I don't notice a difference in increased weight because of how it is distributed, but some people might.

The 2018 Paperwhite was a great device and I read a lot of very long books on it. The 2021 Paperwhite iterates and improves on all the annoyances of the 2018 Paperwhite. Once you experience this version, it would be difficult to go back to reading on an older model.",5.0

645,"Love the new Kindle, but it took some time getting used to the smaller frame because I kept trying to rest my fingers on the screen where the older versions still had space.

647,"I bought this product about a month ago, the text quality is amazing and the library available is second to none. But I was disappointed and frankly annoyed when my copies of various Roald Dahl books were updated to the censored versions without my knowledge or consent. Come to find out they've done this a few times as well including George Orwell's 1984. Ironic given that this is exactly the kind of thing he was warning against. While the hardware is excellent I cannot recommend you get your books through amazon, I've started using a third party ebook service and converting them for my Kindle.",5.0
648,"This is my second Kindle. I got many years of dependable use from my first one but everything wears out eventually.
It took me a few tries to figure out the touchscreen controls, but once I did, it was super easy to use.

Battery life has been great.
No regrets on this purchase.",5.0

That said, the OS is pretty swift, the screen is clear, I wish there was more options for displaying some books and filing away others, like ones you have already read but wish to keep. I ended up sending it back because I didn't feel it raised the bar enough over using my tablet and phone.",5.0
650,"I have had a few paperwhites, but this one is definitely the best yet. Light, easy to use and carry - but also waterproof! I used to fear dropping my kindle in the pool or tub but no longer, I truly believe it’ll be fine.

This is because one fateful recent day it ended up in my washer (bundled into my sheets without realizing) and went through a whole wash cycle! I did not realize it was enjoying a bath with my laundry until I went to put the sheets in the dryer. To my surprise, when I removed it from its watery vacation - my trusty kindle still worked! I am very impressed with their waterproofing, even though I dont reccomend trying a wash cycle yourself.

Rest assured your paperwhite is safe while reading at the beach, pool or tub - they’re strong little devices.",5.0
651,"I upgrade from a kindle that was 10 years old. The main reason for why I got a new one is that I wanted one that was water resistant and didn't want to worry about damaging it while sailing. I am really enjoying this new kindle. I like the touch screen (major upgrade from my old one), the screen is a good size. It's not too big and fits enough words on it that I am not constantly flipping to the next page. I like how you can turn up the brightness if you want to. I have been mostly keeping the brightness all the way down because you don't need it if you're in good light. When you do turn the brightness up all the way it's too bright. The battery life seems to be good too. I have used it every day for 1-3 hours since I got it (6 days now) and the battery is at 77%. I did get worried the first day that I got it because I thought that the battery had already fallen to 85%, but then I realized that I was looking at the percentage of the book that I already read. The layout of the Kindle is very different than my old one (not too surprising since my old one is 10 years old) and it did take me a few minutes to learn the new layout. Overall I am very happy.

Update: I have had my new kindle for over a year now and still love it. I took it on two Pacific crossings, which was great. The battery life was great for when you're trying to conserve power. I think that I was using it for 10-12 hours a day for a month and charged it only a few times. I also accidently tested out the water resistantness. It got swamped by waves a few times with no problems.",5.0
652,"I like size and connectivity changes in the new Kindle Paperwhite (8 GB), but the down side is that the screen skips pages as you are reading, something my previous 4 Kindles did not do. It is very disruptive to have to stop and relocate your place in the book before you can resume reading. My husband's new Kindle does the same thing, and I have found numerous comments about it online. It does seem to help if you do not hold the Kindle but place it on a table or other surface and only touch it to swipe pages..............",5.0
653,I am in LOVE with the paperwhite. This is the second one I’ve owned since they were released years ago. The screen is perfect for reading in brightly lit areas as well as dark rooms at night. The battery life is great and lasts for weeks on a single charge even when binge reading.,5.0
654,"I hoped that replacing my 10 year old Kindle with this one would eliminate glitches, and though my new Kindle is better… aren’t they all just kinda glitchy? I’m not any kind of expert in the nuts and bolts of this technology, but for the price I’d expect a device that responds to taps and searches more quickly, and doesn’t suddenly go dim or take so long to turn a page that I tap again— only to then be two pages ahead of where I was. I’d also love a device that— when on warm screen mode— doesn’t wake up with blinding blue screen.

The other area of disappointment is that the Kindle Paperwhite is not available in a size comfortable to hold in one hand, which is how I like to read. It’s too big, but I realize this one is a personal preference.

Back to my first points— why does Amazon, with basically unlimited resources, keep turning out an inferior products?",5.0
655,"this new kindle is replacing my old paperwhite from 2017. Love the dark mode. I use it in bed and fall asleep, so it goes into standby all night, so I wish it would power off after a set time to conserve battery even more. I don't like the way both paperwhites have to be powered off. You have to push and hold the button and wait for it to respond. It takes too long for me. I wish there were some kind of sliding switch that could be used for instant shutdown. Also, I wish there were more choices of oragami cases for sale. My first paperwhite kindle had lots of cases to choose from. This kindle doesn't have as many choices and the pattern that I liked didn't work well because the magnets aren't strong enough to hold the stand in place. Aside from these problems, I love my kindle",5.0
656,"I got my partner and I a pair of kindle paperwhites before one of our camping trips. After our trip was over (we both finished 2-3 books each) our kindles we're still at 70%. It took a little over a week for my battery to drop below 30%. For reference I spend at least an hour reading each day and will spend up to 6 hours reading on my days off work. I highly recommend opting for the version with the backlight. There was a sale and I was debating between an older model with more storage, or the newer backlit model with 8gb. I have 10 books currently downloaded and haven't run into any storage space issues. The great thing about a Paperwhite is that is ONLY does books (visual and audio) so the battery lasts longer and you can't accidentally fill your memory space with photos or applications.",5.0

659,"I am liking my new kindle, great battery life. What I find very annoying is the power switch is on the bottom of the device.

If you liked the last Kindle, the bigger screen real estate and the USB-C are welcome upgrades.",5.0
661,"Background: Prior to this model, I was using the Kindle Oasis which had a terrible battery life. I much prefer the Kindle Oasis form factor, however just 1 year of use, the batter life issue became a major hinderance. I was having to recharge once or twice a day! I read using my Kindle for hours daily and I was not expecting to have such battery issues! After a year with such terrible battery performance, AND seeing the new Kindle Paperwhite came with updated USB-C, I decided it was worth it to purchase the new model.

Pros:
The Battery Life is improved over my Kindle Oasis - like a HUGE change for the better. I can go days without charging! Also, USB-C charging is so much better than micro!

Screen: I like the size of the screen and appreciate the addition of the warmth setting! The backlighting is also excellent.

Cons:
Form Factor: My preference is for the Oasis - having two page-turning buttons. Also, it just felt good to hold. This model Kindle Paperwhite does not fit in my hand as well as the Oasis did. I dislike how the screen is not centered, the margin below the screen, with the KINDLE branding makes this device feel off-balance.

I hope to someday come back to the Kindle Oasis, until then, the Kindle Paperwhite is an excellent e-reader for most readers with a long-lasting battery and other additions that make reading an absorbing experience.",5.0

I need bright white for my reading. The warm function gives me eye strain, so it sits on 0. The new Paperwhite is lighter weight. It makes a huge difference.

The fonts are easier on the eye, and the screen has a golden color light that dims, not just white light, which is much easier on the eyes. You can adjust the spacing between the lines, and the Home Screen is nicer showing the book covers.

This is ok, touchscreen, but have to be careful to not accidently touch the screen, like when reading in bed, and shift around. Sometimes with an accidental touch there seems to be several pages turned or maybe a return to a chapter or some other location, and can take some searching to get back where I was. And I will make the comment, at the total risk of having others tell me to RTFM...I have not found how to keep or change the footnote area that sometimes displays page number, or ""location"", or percentage read. Seems to come and go and I have not found easily how to set this and keep it. It would be nice to be able to return when I have mistakenly hit the screen and botched my reading. Size is much better than previous, can actually carry in a pocket while not feeling near so restricted as trying to read on a stinking phone (letting my bias toward a phone being something other than a phone show through there, sorry.)

And the battery life deteriorates over constant use. It gets to a point where I have to purchase a new version, which is a good marketing ploy for amazon.
This is my latest machine and over the last month has ‘hung’ more times than any of its predecessors. One time the touch screen became completely unresponsive, and holding the power button brings up a menu option to Restart or Power Down (or Cancel). Stupid. If the display is locked you can’t make a selection!!!!!!!!
I was able to fight through that and get it to restart again. It’s stalled twice since then, but a restart makes it operational again. I’m disappointed that it is not as stable as my prior Kindles were.",5.0
674,"I used to own the original version Kindle digital reader (a looong time ago). I enjoyed it but got away from reading digital books. Watching videos on YouTube and asking a coworker, I decided to try again since I've found that reading digital books on my iPad can be cumbersome because it is heavy and can cause eye strain.
The Kindle Paperwhite is light, easy on the eyes, and much easier to use than its original version. The setup was really easy since I already have an Amazon Echo set up to my wifi, all I really had to do was turn it on and confirm that it goes with my Amazon account. It connected automatically to my wifi and I was all set up.
I like that I can also read library books on the Kindle and that previous books I purchased were still there and available to read. Now, I might be able to catch up on my reading. Ha! I like the warm light setting and the page turn feature that makes it look like you are turning pages when you tap the screen to advance to the next page.

Another feature I love about this year’s version of the Kindle Paperwhite is that the battery life is outstanding, something that the 2018 Paperwhite and the only Oasis device I had previously wasn’t even upon the initial months of purchase.

Hopefully that the next version will allow for wireless charging like the special edition of the Paperwhite’s “Signature Edition”.

- was a welcome upgrade over 10th Gen. ... but I had to try it to be convinced...

Here's what I like:
- e-Ink screen still best in sunlight, outdoor reading
- screen is noticeably larger than last 10th gen. device c.2019
- about 1/4"" higher and wider, but still fits in jeans pockets - carry anywhere!
- new backlight option includes variable warm tone
- waterproof
- light weight - 200 grams - easier to hold for long reading sessions
- added USB-C charge connection (finally, last of my devices to drop micro-USB)
- overall noticeably faster - screen changes, swipes and on-screen keyboard typing
- same $139 price-point for 8GB (plenty of space)
- On device shopping and purchasing of eBooks (can't do on iPad App)
- hands-down best choice for outdoor reading - see photo
- battery life is excellent, can even be a solar powered Kindle with this 14watt panel - see photo

Same design challenges that still needs work...
- audio through Bluetooth, connecting and getting screen reader to speak is WAY too many taps (software changes needed! - PLEASE!)
- wish power button was on the TOP edge, not the bottom edge - or make it recessed - often setting device down turns off
- could still be a tiny bit faster, but this is first one that speed is acceptable

Lighting is great. it has options for note taking and high lighting. Is it worth the price you pay? If you have the skills to work with it right then yes. If not then no. if you don't mind that over 70 percent of the kindle unlimited 0 cost books have editing and grammatical mistakes. As well as story development issues etc. You can see my written skills. For me to say the grammer is an issue should speak for itself. Some of the writers feel like english is not there first language. When reading a book the last thing anyone wants to deal with is poorly used words/slang that are used outa context by the wrong classification of character. lack of real life experience with said people or poor research during the written process. If you have comcast as your provider and are not very techi this item is not a good purchase. I say this for people like myself. Not for people who don't realize just how techi they are and blow it off as a simple problem fixer. ALL THIS ASIDE....I would buy this ITEM again.

705,"I upgraded via trade-in of my 2018 Paperwhite when the 2021 went on sale ($109) so I received a $30 credit for trade-in value and the 20% discount Amazon provides on top of the sale. I was hesitant at first to upgrade considering I just purchased the 2018 version in September 2021 right before new one was released, but I couldn't wait any longer. The 2018 was noticeably slower to respond to touch and longer to download. I also found the text to be somewhat fuzzy. Not only is the 2021 faster to respond, the text seems clearer. Another thing I didn't like about the 2018 was the brightness seemed too bright with too much blue light compared to the original Kindle. I think it was maybe the placement of the screen lighting which is so much better in the newer version even without having to turn on dark mode or warm light. For these reasons I recommend the upgrade for people on the fence about switching from the 2018. For people who are new to the Kindle line-up, here are my complaints about the Paperwhite: Still no physical page-turn buttons and could be more ergonomic for one-hand use.

We got away from using our previous kindles and started using our iPads, however when attempting to read out in the sunlight, it was very difficult. I think the Kindle Paperwhite may be converting us back.",5.0

715,"I purchased the Paperwhite about 6 months ago. There wasn’t really anything wrong with my old one, I’d just had it for many years and thought it would be nice to update/upgrade. I really regret it. This one is a pain to navigate from book to library to anything else. The page swiping is inconsistent and when I’m trying to swipe a few pages back or forward I often have to battle with it bc it only wants to go back/forward 1 page and will return itself to the page I am trying to leave. Annoying. If this is representative of all the new kindles I may look at different readers in the future.",5.0
716,"I bought it to replace my kindle 6"". I thought it would be faster, but it is not. Still super slow. I set up a passcode and I have to type it very slowly, otherwise it will not capture it properly. and going to settings, or any other task, it is really annoying how slow it is. However it is a joy for reading. The warm light is very helpful to read at night, battery life is decent, and display very crisp. And of course works perfectly within the Amazon ecosystem. Not very easy to add books from other sources though (DRM free books for example).
What could/should be improved and why my 3 stars:
- Price. I would only recommend to buy it during promotions. I don't think it is worth the full price, specially with so many flaws (slow, low memory, display size) . Not even mentioning that Amazon makes a lot of money on content on it. (razor-blade strategy)
- It should be faster and with more memory (for a lower price).
- this is totally personal, but I would love to have it with 8"" display size. 6.8"" a little bit small, and the 10.2"" on the new scribe too big. But this is being picky!.",5.0

Positives: backlight works great, warmth option is really nice, adjustable brightness is fantastic, very lightweight, easy to hold.

Negatives: the computer processor is very slow, which is crazy for a modern device of any kind. Browsing for books is so slow and the screen takes a long time to refresh. Best to browse on Amazon.com directly and buy books from there, don’t bother doing it on the Kindle itself unless you have hours to do it. This is absolutely NOT a replacement for an iPad or tablet - not even close.

Overall: Reading is GREAT. Web browsing is very bad. Backlight and warmth options are excellent. Worth the buy but you will need to have your laptop or phone nearby to complete any tasks except reading a book. Fair trade on that issue given the low price and extensive Amazon book catalog.",5.0

There is a little ""read"" in the upper right hand corner when finished, but it does not move them to a separate section. I only have about 30+ book.

736,"it might be operator error but so far I am not a huge fan. I had a 2010 Kindle and I remember the day I bought it. The Home page was MY Home page without all the extra ads for book options. I had it organized by folders/collections and once I finished a book, it went in the folder. Any book yet to read was listed below the collections.

In this new Kindle, I created a 'Collection' and thought I moved read books to it but they are still on the 'Home' page which has TMI. Yes, there is a banner in the upper right corner marked read but I don't want to see the book anymore. I want it tucked away to the folder nice and neat and organized.

I do like the warm lighting. I can read on the patio when the darkness falls which is great. I don't like having to position my finger to touch screen scroll to the next page and the chaos of the Home page is awful. It should not be called a Home page. It is advertising galore with book recommendations I would not consider. I want my old Kindle Home page - if anyone who does updates is listening can do. And what is with the check marks? I have to do a search to understand that. I really, really don't like this Kindle. I want to put a new battery in my old Kindle and get on with life. I also hate that I cannot put a password other than numbers. Are the Kindle creators listening?

737,"This is a nice Kindle to read, I bought this to replace my 8 year old Paperwhite which I broke the screen.

This one is easy to read, visually, it's a nice improvement.

The low rating is due to almost daily needs to restart the device. I'll open the Kindle to a white page, I then have to restart and reopen the book that I was reading. I also frequently lose the progress that I had when I need to restart.

This would get a 5 star rating if it worked as well as my old Paperwhite. I think I needed to restart that twice in 8 years.

The pinhole type is even visible after turning the screen off (so there is no image and 0% brightness). With the screen off, it looks like a shiny dot.

My previous gen Kindles did not have these problems.

742,"I've owned about 5 Kindles over the years. This one is my favorite even over the newest Oasis because I like the shape better. A warm light is an essential feature for me after using the Oasis and the lighting on my PW is slightly more even than on my Oasis, even though the PW has less LED's. The screen clarity and sharpness look identical to me, so it really comes down to the shape since they fit about the same amount of text. Unless you really can't live without the page turn buttons, then the PW is probably the better option for most people. I thought I was one of those people who needed the physical buttons, but I don't miss them at all.

I will say there is something I love about the Kindle basic with front light size wise. I still take that one out with me when I travel because it's a really great size, light, and very pocketable. I think my ideal device would be a Kindle basic with 300ppi, warm light, and shrunken bezels to fit say a 6.3-6.5 inch screen while keeping the physical dimensions the same. That would probably be my unicorn device. They could call it the Kindle plus and sell it for 120ish and would be a day one purchase for me.

I predict the next Oasis will be 8-10 inches and have note taking capability with a stylus. There's not much of a reason to spend the extra money on the Oasis now that this newest PW is out. It's that good.",5.0
743,"I purchased the new Kindle Paperwhite last week during “Prime Day”; good price discount, got it for $88. The device is for my husband, he is an avid and voracious reader! I use my iPad to read “kindle” books. My husband uses his iPhone “kindle” app (the battery life is not good on iPhones, and reading books drains them even faster). So, we thought Kindle Paperwhite is the perfect solution. We were right!! Seemless integration with our library’s “Libby” app - books are delivered immediately to Kindle! Also, any books bought/borrowed (kindle unlimited) from Amazon is also immediately available on Kindle to read. We only have one account on Amazon, however our reading choices vastly differ. The library “grouping/collection “ option makes it super easy for my husband to access his books without having to scroll through my reading list.

757,"Update June 13, 2022 Amazon has agreed to issue a refund for this Paper White. I return the product to Amazon tomorrow. Customer Service, for this organization, continues to consider the customer when it comes to issues such as this; which is very encouraging when doing business with such a big retailer.

Update: June 12, 2022 Note: I seldom write such a negative review but feel other people purchasing this paperwhite should know what they are buying. 3rd replacement 8G paperwhite/box says refurbished even though I originally purchased a new one.

I received a third replacement 8G paperwhite (apparently refurbished) from Amazon because the other two units went to a frozen white screen after having it for a short period of time. I've have had this unit for approximately three/four weeks and was working fine until last night when it started to reboot it's self for no reason and failed to bring up a book or wouldn't go from page to page....once again reverting to the 3rd unit's slow down. The entire device was in slow motion. These are the same things that have happened with the previous two devices eventually leading to nothing but a frozen white screen.

Today this unit has been a frozen white screen all day. I am not able to try and reboot it due to the white screen and turning it off and on does nothing to fix this unit. I will be calling Amazon and asking for a full refund. Amazon has been good in replacing this paperwhite (3) times but I am done getting replacements that keep doing the same thing the previous ones did. There must be something internally wrong in this paperwhite's structure and will research that further on some other web sites since Amazon would not allow me to turn this model in for a different model type the last go around. I don't want a replacement of the same product at this time. I am done with this paper white and greatly disappointed that this unit is such a ""lemon"".

My other devices which include a five year old Kindle and a newer I Phone are not experiencing any of these issues with either the kindle app or kindle unlimited. I even changed the charging plug to the new unit with no change to the frozen white screen. How does a five year old refurbished Kindle still work while this one doesn't?. Checked my WiFi strength and all is well...no other issues with all the other devices using a WiFi connection. My I phone and my older kindle are not experiencing the frozen screen or connectivity issues that this Kindle is experiencing. They both come up without any issues with my Kindle library and Kindle unlimited.

I'm not sure how Amazon is going to react with my request, but will update this review once I speak with someone from their helpdesk. They have been very helpful in the past but I wasn't asking for a refund...I accepted a replacement. I had hoped that the third paperwhite would work as expected and am greatly disappointed that it did not. Be thorough in your research before purchasing this paperwhite, or better yet....get a different model.

I use Amazon quite a bit and have never had issues with a product such as this reader. Returns have always been seamless and customer service has always been helpful. It's very disappointing to be having these issues with a company that I have grown to respect over the years for their efficiency in dealing with these kinds of issues. I take care of all my electronics and purchased a leather/type protective book cover for the very first unit. I've used that cover with each of these readers. The unit itself looks as new as it did the day I received it, but doesn't work anymore.

Good luck...I wouldn't wish this experience on anyone.",5.0

764,I had the 2018 paperwhite for over a year and it was a great device but I always wished it had a bigger screen and warm lighting. I always knew warm lighting was better for the eyes but once you actually experience it it becomes essential. My eyes feel so much better reading for long periods. I always keep it on no matter what. I might turn it down when I have my overall brightness higher but it is always on. And the extra screen means less page turns and feels more equal to the size or a paperback book. The page turn animation is a very nice touch and makes the experience better adding some life to reading on a kindle. I'd highly recommend buying a case as the smaller bezels make it look sleek it also makes it harder to hold and the case adds some extra thickness making it easier to hold one handed. The quicker page turns and it feeling faster overall is a huge plus. I don't need lightning speed from a kindle but having the updated internet for it to support higher bandwidth makes it so much faster going through the store. I honestly don't see a huge difference in overall lighting with all the extra LED lights but that was never a selling point for me as I thought the previous ones brightness was fine. Overall I'd highly recommend buying this kindle even if you have the previous paperwhite. I can't imagine not having warmlight and the bigger display now.

781,"I bought it to replace my 6-inch Voyage and because I was interested in a bigger screen. I love the screen, but I miss the physical buttons on my Voyage. The screen tap method works OK, but a tap the right side of the screen turns the page forward, and a tap on the left turns the page backward. I'd prefer to have the top part of the screen turn back pages, and the bottom part turn pages forward. I have years of muscle memory to overcome, plus, it would make one handed page turns more comfortable. Maybe this could be fixed in a software update? It'd be great if that were done.

I also like the smooth screen that integrates solidly with the bezel. No dust to collect in the corners. The Type ""C"" connector is much appreciated. The sooner we get to a single 'universal' connection standard, the better, in my mind.

I don't really use the other stuff. Warm screen options, more lights, seem irrelevant to me. They work, but after checking to see that they do work, I don't really know how well they work on a day-to-day basis.

787,"My Gen. 11 Kindle Paperwhite has adjustable warm light (yes!), and a larger screen at 6.8”, which doesn’t sound like a much bigger screen, but the outer dimensions add up to feeling more like a book, at 4.9” x 6.9” overall. I find it easier to read than my previous Kindles, and I always add the Decal Girl matte “Library” skin. I also find it useful to have the Spigen grip on the back near the top, as the edges are narrow. A PopSocket would work, as well. I’ve had a Kindle since the 2nd generation, after they got past the ‘klunky’ style of the first one. The organizational features have changed a bit, but I find that I can navigate them fairly easily, after 2 days of having this one. Thanks, amazon - well done! 🤓",5.0
788,"I bought this on prime day, with the case and charging combo. My boyfriend told me I should buy one as I always read books on my phone. I didn't think it would be a huge improvement to my phone, I didn't think I would use it nearly as much as I have been! This is amazing. I love how crisp the text is and how easy it is to customize the font type, size, and boldness. Downloading new books is simple, having kindle unlimited is great, so many books are offered. When reading before bed, I turn the warmth up and it doesn't hurt my eyes at all. I just can not get over how crisp the text is! I love how it is lightweight and easy to hold. The water resistance is a plus, have yet to read in the bath! Lol.",5.0

791,"I purchased this Kindle on a whim and was mostly curious about how it felt to read on an e-ink display since I had heard so much praise regarding it. Prior to this, I regularly used my iPad or iPhone to read, the iPad being much more convenient due to its large size. I don't think I ever really felt any eye strain using those, but the Kindle has undoubtedly been the most comfortable to use by far. I've used it at night with all the lights off and it still feels comfortable to use -- I didn't feel like I had to squint due to its brightness -- and I've also used it under direct sunlight, where it felt just as natural as reading on paper. I definitely did not expect myself to enjoy reading on a Kindle this much, but after trying it, I can confidently say that if given the choice, I wouldn't go back.",5.0

794,"This is not a technical review because I don’t pay attention to or know anything about specifics of brightness or whatnot. I just wanted something I could read on with one hand while I hold my baby or throw in my bag on the go.

I didn’t have the old kindle so I can’t completely tell you all the differences but I did hold this new version up to my cousin’s 2018 version and the screen is bigger, we loved the warmth function, and I think overall I would recommend the new version compared to the (cheaper) older version.

Get yourself a pop socket and stick it on the back. Read with one hand. At time of purchase, mine came with 4 months of free kindle unlimited. Unfortunately, I love it… I’m unsure if I’ll continue to pay for it but for the time being, let me tell you, I am taking advantage. Use your library for books too. I love that it is so easy to look up books in the kindle store and I LOVE that I can pair it with my Goodreads account. This helps me track my books efficiently and remember to at least give a star rating for my thoughts when I finish a book.

I love reading this in bed at night. I can turn the brightness levels down, there is a dark mode setting, I can make the font bigger when I take off my glasses…

Buy this and love your reading life. Highly recommend.",5.0
795,"It's just wonderful to read on an e-ink kindle. They did a great job on the backlight, too.
But wow, navigating and using it is just horrible. It took me DAYS to figure out how to go back to the main menu from a book. They added a swipe from the top function that pretty much any phone user knows well. This lets you change settings on the fly, which is great, but the problem is, it establishes that swiping is how you get around. However, there's actually a small tap section at the top of the screen that you need to tap, not swipe, in order to bring up the UI to actually go home. So, way to screw that one up, Amazon. Taping anywhere else just turns the page.
Navigating the library and store is also horribly slow and unwieldly. But that matters very little, because you can just use the website or your phone to manage your books, and all you really need from the Kindle is the ability to display and turn pages, and it does that VERY well.",5.0

I was able to get it at an incredible deal during a sale and it was more than worth the $80 I paid. My new favorite device for sure. I'm reading more and it helps with my unwinding routine at night to not look at another bright screen.

I'm really impressed with the 6.8 screen size which looks just as big as my 7 inch Oasis. Love the warm light feature and thin body. The Paperwhite""s battery lasts weeks and outlasts my Oasis!! I've always been disappointed by the battery life of the Oasis.
The new Paperwhite still has that portability Factor where I can just throw it in my jacket pocket and read anywhere. It has a zippy performance and seems to be faster than my Oasis. The USBC cable means you I can use the same plug as my phone. I don't like the old USB on the Oasis. I don't need the Paperwhite plus with the extra features. 'm not a big fan of the automatic sensor which I have on the Oasis, and I usually shut off. For most people the basic Paperwhite will be just fine for daily reading. The only thing negative I can say is that the paperwhite does not have page turning buttons like the Oasis, which is a nice feature to have but I don't always use them.
My picture shows the Oasis on the left and the new Paperwhite on the right.

The only thing I don't like about this new version is how my books are originally organized. I'm hoping that I can organize them differently. Just haven't gotten to it yet. Plus, how the books are listed has changed. Rather than just the title and author, there's a picture of the book itself. Again, perhaps this can be changed. I need to look.

If i try to put it on a table, it just turns off, which kind of ruins it for me. Next kindle should have a power button that is easy to reach and not placed in a deliberate spot that makes me hate it. Although this kind of ruins it for me, it still is very high quality and it feels like im reading an actual book an not an e-reader. 7/10 design, 9/10 performance.",5.0

With no side buttons on the new kindle, more than one page is often skipped by using what someone thought to be a good idea and eliminating side buttons for advancing or backing up pages of a book. I had to replace my original kindle that had this feature because kindle longer supports the version of kindle I owned. Turns out I went from the first version to the 11th version and you didn't make it better. How is that possible? Had this version been my first kindle, for sure I'd be back to reading hard copy. There must be a good reason I now have finger prints on bottom of the kindle---something that never happened before. There must be a reason why it is so time consuming to download books from my previous kindle. There must be a reason why I had to buy a new kindle which was still perfectly good.

819,"I upgraded to this device from the 6” Kindle. Nothing wrong with the old one, I just thought this one offered more bells and whistles than the last iteration. Spoiler Alert - it does not.

Recently, I finally bit the bullet and began taking advantage of my Audible membership. I like using my Galaxy Note20 Ultra phone to read on because it’s easier to manage, size-wise. The Kindle app for Android is fantastic! It loads in seconds, and it’s very versatile and responsive. And when I use Audible, I can read along with the narrator.
When I got my new Paperwhite Kindle, I was excited to do the same thing. However, on the Paperwhite, not only can you NOT read along with the narrator (you’re given the choice of text with no audio, or audio with no text). I’m baffled as to why an app performs better, and has better options than the device itself.
Also, there is no speaker on the Paperwhite, so, you’re forced to use a Bluetooth device to enjoy your audiobooks. On my phone, I don’t need to use.an ancillary listening device. With the Paperwhite, you have to touch the very top of of the screen to access an unimpressive menu; on the app, you can touch anywhere on the page, where you can bring up a menu with several more options. With the app, I can also color-code my highlights. I use one color for words I’ve just learned, and another color for key phrases, another color for foreign words, and, yet another for names I want to look up later. You get none of that on the Kindle device.

Honestly, the Kindle app has this thing beat in every category. It makes me wonder why I even bought the thing, when the free app is decidedly better in every way, other than screen size.

All in all, I actually like the Paperwhite Kindle. However, after forking over $150 (including tax), I still find myself reading on my phone quite a bit. There are times when I’m going out, and carrying two devices can be cumbersome, I obviously opt for my phone over the Kindle as the device I’ll take with me.

Dear Amazon, on your next Kindle iteration, please:
1) add a speaker to your Kindle
2) Give users the option to read along with the narration. I’ve found it makes the narrators performance even more impressive.",4.0

821,"This is my 3rd kindle over ten years, and I've been a long time fan/user. In short - if you carry your kindle everywhere with you like I do then the bigger size of this unit and the hair-trigger power buttons are both net problems.

For size: this is constantly falling out of my pockets and is uncomfortable when holding with one hand. The smaller legacy devices for the Paperwhite/Voyage/etc. all comfortably fit into the back pocket of my (men's) pants. That's out the window now. Best case I get about 2/3 of this unit and then it feels like I'm carrying around textbook wedged in there. It also no longer fits entirely into most of my coat pockets (side or breast pockets), so I have it hanging out on pockets where my old devices fit fine. As a result - I've had this for about two weeks and have dropped it a dozen times just sitting on a chair or in the car.

For the power button: this is constantly turning on in my pocket despite my efforts to not press the button. The screen sensitivity is also such that I have had to walk back 10-20 pages in whatever book I'm reading. I've been reading a book or two per month on kindle for 10 years and, though this has happened to me once in a while, it is frustratingly common so far with this new one.

Lastly - both of these issues combine to make single handed reading for right-handed folks a cramp-inducing mess. For better or worse there's not much bezel area to pinch to hold the device up without accidental page turns. The side effect is that I naturally start to prop up the device with my pinky finger, which then hits the power button and turns off the screen. I have to hold much of the weight of the device on just the tip of my pinky finger (which gets painful) or otherwise use it two handed / propped up.

I really wanted to like this device for the warm light, and that feature is a great relief, but I'm having trouble overcoming the discomfort/inconvenience of not being able to throw it in my back pocket and then pull it out to read one handed while waiting in line or laying on the couch. I don't know if I'll keep it.",5.0

I have also struggled to find a self standing case that works well with this size. It annoys me that almost every time I open the cover of the case I get a “warming up” msg before I can slide the touch screen to activate it, but otherwise it works much like my prior paperweight.

What I like about the Kindle:
+ screen is good size and clarity
+ it is adequately snappy
+ syncs across devices
+ functional note and highlighting, easily shareable
+ the nigh shift is great

What I don’t like about the Kindle
- I’ll frequently tap the screen somewhere and pull up the menu or turn a page, not immediately clear if it goes forward or backwards
- not immediately clear how to access brightness
- - the power button is on the bottom of the device. I have more than once accidentally locked the screen just by propping the device up. This is a fireable offense by the lead engineer who championed this location. A monkey would choose a better placement than the bottom of the device….
- - - YOU CANNOT, I REPEAT, YOU CANNOT ACCESS YOUR READING WISH LIST ON THE KINDLE. That’s right, you added a book to your wishlist in your app? PC? Even kindle? Awesome! Yeah but you won’t see that on your kindle. Literally adding a book on the kindle to a wishlist is INACCESSIBLE. You have to “download a sample” or use “Goodreads”.

843,"I have buying Kindles since the Kindle 2 back in 2009. I’ve purchased the K2, K3, Voyage (the best offering IMHO), Oasis (worst offering in my POV), the original Paperwhite, and the 2018 Paperwhite. This Kindle is a modest improvement over the 2018 Paperwhite. It starts MUCH faster. The lighting is great. And, it’s a little bigger. The placement of the power button at the bottom has never been an issue for me, so I don’t mind it. Hardware is fine.

My only complaints are related to the software. Amazon has gotten MUCH more aggressive in pushing content. Each software “upgrade” makes it worse. (Same reason I couldn’t stand the Fire tablet & recently ditched the 4K Fire Stick.) I have never really minded ads on the Kindle before because they didn’t interfere with getting to my content and sometimes I found a book I wanted to read. But recent software updates annoyingly push Amazon content to the forefront, something I resent in a device that I’ve purchased. I strongly believe the “home” screen should be configured by the customer, rather than consisting of advertisements! I paid to have ads removed, but that only impacts the screensaver, so certainly not worth $20. Let me get rid of ALL ads, and I’d pay three times that!

Another complaint is that Amazon randomly pushes updates, and it’s annoying that they can’t be delayed or scheduled! One more issue — for heaven’s sake please turn off auto highlights! They are SO annoying, and the feature is buried, so not intuitive to turn off. I bet that the percentage of customers who want this feature is tiny, but Amazon continues to default to it.

I still love the Kindle and think it’s the best device for reading. But, I my reservations grow, and I fear that aggressiveness in pushing content will soon ruin it. If this continues, I will be looking at other options and don’t mind paying more if I can be rid of ads and simply enjoy reading. If you’re going to charge for a device, then let customers have control of it. If the device is merely a way to push content (as the Kindle is fast becoming), then give it away to prolific readers.",2.0

853,"Only one dislike, the old one could fit in some of my overshirt pockets and most of my pants pockets. This is bigger and so I must carry it separately. I love the extra screen area, it makes reading easier and page turning a little less frequent. I really like the waterproof feature (although I haven't tested it yet). My last version drowned when it got put in a bag with some spilled soda. Oh well.

This is a delight to read, especially on the beach when you can't begin to read your phone even at 100% brightness. The battery life does suffer some from the lighting, but it is well worth it for the ease of reading in dim surroundings. This is our family's 7th kindle (I still have the one with a keyboard and it still works). The resolution is great, I put a technical journal PDF on it and tried to read it. The print was WAY too small to read, but I looked with a powerful magnifying glass and the tiny tiny print was beautifully formed. I suspect that's part of what makes it easy to read normal print.",4.0

I have had it just over two months and I have only put it on the charger it 4 times, and I read multiple hours a day. I haven't had to tested the waterproof feature yet. But having kids I'm thankful that that is an option.

In the begining, first two weeks I did have a few issues where when I would try to load the store/ recommended books (to buy a book) the screen would go blank. After I did a hard reboot I had less issues. Then I had to do a hard reboot a second time a week later and haven't had any further issues with that feature.",4.0

The process takes a couple of minutes. I also really love this particular model for waterproof, I take it with me to the bath and I don’t worry that I will drop it into the water. The battery with WiFi turned off lasts about a month. When buying, I misunderstood the functionality of audible, I thought that the robot would read books aloud to me.

Turning pages is ridiculously difficult as is navigating the stupid thing. It doesn’t do much so I feel like the things it does do should be perfect. I haven’t used it outside yet due to the rainy weather we’re having, but hopefully the lack of glare will make up for some of its other downfalls.

I read a lot, probably 20 or more hours a week, almost all on Kindle. The current 2021,11th generation, is by far the best I've used.

The larger display makes a real difference and the touchscreen sensitivity and faster page turns are the most important differences to me but there are many other significant upgrades.

It's absolutely worth buying at full price. However, I bought mine on Prime Day and traded in my 7th generation model. With the Prime Day discount, trade-in, etc., it cost less than $50 for the upgrade and I'm delighted.

I enjoy audiobooks on the go, but when I sit down to read at night I like to have the audio available to go along with as I read.

Amazon, Just just ""wifi on or off""! Im just amazed you wound even make this crazy change!😤
2. Can you change the highlights function?
I highlights stuff for notes to be saved later and often this includes a bit of a long paragraph. But the problem is just a slight touch of the highlighted part and the whole thing is immediately changed to edit mode. Can't you guys make it so that a long press is needed instead?

The 20% discount when you trade in your old Kindle certainly helps! Even so, it's easy enough to convert epubs that I bought from elsewhere and put them on my Paperwhite, so that's never been a factor for me.

I had the last generation Paperwhite, and I did like it a lot. I upgraded because I was interested in the bigger screen, faster page turns and usb-c charging.

The 20% faster page turns doesn't really seem like that big of a deal to me over the previous generation. If you have a regular Kindle or an older Paperwhite, I think you'll really notice it, though. The screen wake doesn't seem any faster than my last Paperwhite; I think that could still use some improvement.

So trying to find books to download is just too difficult. I also dislike that I am getting “pre-read” books and have to deal with the idiotic highlighting - it’s really a distraction. If someone wants to highlight their book, I have no problem but why do I have to get those notes throughout my book.

If there is a book you are listening to/reading there is no way to get back to home screen w/out turning it off, then on again. No home button. Scrolling left or right only turns the pages.

892,"With over 6000 reviews i know my 2 cents worth may not mean a lot, but I'm giving a review anyway. The reason I purchased the Paperwhite was my older Fire HD gen 8's battery was starting to discharge fairly fast. I read a lot and figured from the favorable reviews, the Paperwhite with it supposed long battery life sounded good. I thought I didn't need a Fire just to read. Wrong! First impression, the Paperwhite is nice and light, compared to the weight of my Fire. From there it was down hill. After giving it a week or so I was still unable to get a comfortable reading brightness and print darkness. Can't darken the print, only make the font bigger, which sucks. It's just gray and gives me eyestrain and the yellow warm light is a joke. My Fire has more font, spacing, and margin adjustments. Looking at books in my library is almost useless, the covers are just grey with little detail. Really, really miss that color here. Can't turn off Wi-Fi. You can only turn airplane mode on. That sucks battery down. And yes I turned battery saver on. That just makes you wait a bit for the reader to wake up. Battery life still not what's advertised. And don't get me started on the ""leather"" cover. It's a chunk of plastic with the thinnest, hardest leather known to man. It does protect the reader quite well but sounds like a plastic dinner plate when you set it on a table. All in all the Paperwhite is not worth its price and eye stain, I'm going back to my Fire HD. It is so much easier to read on and I don't have to go to my phone to read emails. Maybe I'll figure out how to replace its battery. AND, I love having that color.",3.0

898,"I love this device and thought I would particulary like the warm light. I have a Samsung tablet that I read books on with a nice parchment background and thought the warm light would be something similar, it is not.

It can be beneficial if trying to reduce light in a dark room where you would be keeping your partner awake, but night mode is better for that. So I NEVER use Warm mode.
I have the previous Paprewhite in addition to the 2021 version. The main thing I like is the bigger screen and better resolution, so much so I would never think of picking up the older one, ever!
So there is alot to love with the 2021 Paperwhite, just forget about the warm light.
Battery life is fantastic, be sure to turn on Airplane mode for max life. Also finally a type C connector, thank goodness. I bought the Cobak case and that is a terrific buy.

Only one - very - annoying flaw. Apparently the screen can't be rotated on this version of the Paperwhite and the power button is on the bottom - and is very sensitive. So if you stand it on anything (for instance, a machine at the gym), the slightest jiggle will ""push"" the power button and cause the screen to reset.

So, I was so excited when this finally came today! Especially since when you purchase it, you get 4 months free of Kindle Unlimited. I really wanted to get started reading on the new Kindle and make good use of my subscription.

Well, sad day, this is how my Kindle looked when I received it and tried to power it on. I already traded in my old Kindle, have a free Kindle Unlimited subscription, and well, no functional Kindle to read on.

I had to spend my free time today contacting Amazon to arrange for a replacement to be sent, and the fastest they can replace this is FIVE more days even with my Prime subscription. So there go another 5 days of not using the Kindle Unlimited or getting the joy of reading a book in the evenings.

Oh, and I get to be the one to have to make a trip to UPS to return the non-functional Kindle. How convenient.

Apparently, this device is not well-made, and let's just say, I'm not pleased. I wish I had NEVER traded in my older Kindle!

UPDATE: They sent me a REFURBISHED Kindle rather than a new replacement. What on earth?????!!!!! I even specifically asked customer service if the replacement would be new rather than refurbished and they promised me it would be new because it arrived not functional and was within the 30-day window. Called customer service and they said they would send a new one, but it was on back order.
UPDATE 2 MONTHS AFTER THE LAST UPDATE: Well, received what I thought would finally be my new Kindle after almost 2 months. No joke, another refurbished one.

Overall I like the new paperwhite, and my experience with customer service was positive. I’m disappointed that I have to wait a week for a replacement, but sometimes these things happen and it’s not the end of the world.

Update: I received the replacement and had the same issue. After 1.5 hours chatting with five customer service representatives, the fifth representative was finally able to figure out that there was a problem with the updates and the technical team is working on it. So I’m happy to know this is just a bug, and that they are working on resolving the issues. For those of you who are experiencing the same thing, I wanted you to know Amazon is aware and working on the issue. I really like the new device and the amber lighting option is a game changer for those of us who read in bed in the dark.

unfortunately, i love the device. but i'm a little concerned about what seems to be a very short life of built in obsolescence. it's not like these are costing me pocket change. (maybe it's your pocket change, but not mine)
otherwise, i read a lot, and i read everything on a kindle. i read french and english, and i love the translation function in the paperwhite. i love that i can highlight a character's name and see where else they have been mentioned in the book. i love being able to change the font style and size. i love being able to take notes in it without messing up the ""page"". i love the lightness of it. i'm amazed everyone doesn't own one. i do still read hard copy books occasionally, usually french books i can't find on kindle, and it is so inconvenient. a book is bulky, i have to mark what page i'm on, and i have to have a big fat dictionary at my side.

Battery life is only 1/3 as good as my 7th Gen Paperwhite. Touch screen freezes regularly and sometimes requires a reboot to work properly again. YES it is up to date on firmware.

The kindle is SO lightweight, it makes reading in bed and while traveling even easier! Great backlight for nighttime reading, and I'm so glad they added an adjustable warmth setting to avoid headaches and tired eyes.

It will then skip ahead two pages and I have to tap backwards until I find the page that is the continuation of what I just read. It’s irritating. Also, if you look really closely at the screen, you can see lines where the text shows up. It looks like layers and layers of letters. The picture shows it. It makes me miss my nook, that I paid 50 bucks for on Black Friday ten years ago. I needed a kindle though to have Libby sync books to it.",3.0

The battery life seems like it will last quite a bit longer. Those would not have made the cost worth it. What puts it over the top, the page transition and scrolling speed.

However, my primary gripe with the Kindle is the convoluted way one has to navigate the system to get or return material or actually navigate through the settings to get thing set up the way we want.

However, Amazon has taken a HUGE step backward with the new Paperwhite. On the Home/library page where MY books should appear they've only allowed one horizontal scrolling line for MY books. The rest of the page is full of two lines of ""recommended"" and ""books to read"" choices, all of which you have to purchase, of course, I also found out that IF you pay $20 more to get an ""ad free"" model, this arrangement on your home page stays. I talked to Amazon and that's their most recent ""improvement"" to the Paperwhite in the last software update. Bull! That is a step backwards. No option to get rid of those ""recommended books. They've done some things that I like but every item I like on the 11th generation Paperwhite, there are three I don't. They've made a simple, useful and easy to manage device much more complicated.

That theory and reasoning went out the window. 1st - the fo nt is smaller and lighter 9n the home/library screen. Than either of my e readers. The book layout is fuzzy and dark no matter how bright. But fuzzy...blurry..however you want to put it, is usualess so i put it on list. It's in light printer, the 6th is bold print.

I can change my book font fine. But its usualess if I can't find the title or read to put in Groups. I have a lot of books so my eye strain would literally be impossible.
I was sitting there last night setting it up with a magnifying glass. My vision changes as my MS does. So at least the 6th print is bold.

I called chatted with the help line to see if there was a way to e hence or enlarge the hone screen/library and while I turned it on to follow steps he gave me (before finding out it can't be done) as I turned it on. I swiped it, then it started a reboot the white out on me. I turned it off, gave it a few seconds ds, still nothing but white page. The svc te h told me to shut it down, wait 10 mi utes and restart the eReader. I did and it came back up after looking like going through another reboot. As I stated after he had me do things his supervisor said it couldn't be done.

I almost bought the 7 inch kindel fire 32 gb for 32.98 . I have a 8 inch so 8i debated to get the 7inch instead of a new eReader.
So it's going back due to whiting out and I can't read it. I wish I had gone with my gut and gotten the 7 inch fire fore 32.98
I can't get that deal again, since prine is over. but my Gen 6 is working fine so I guess I will wait till Christmas to see if the 7 inch goes on sale.

But the smaller margins make it difficult to hold without constantly accidentally changing pages. I read curled up on my side 99% of the time, and I always lose my page (sometimes it skips several pages, and it's difficult to find where you left off), or drop the Kindle trying not to touch the screen. It also frequently locks up and won't respond. The worst part is that your books aren't actually there. We recently had a power outage for several days. I finished the book I was reading and went to my library to start a new one. It couldn't open any of my books because it had no internet connection. Rendered it completely useless. I camp frequently (no internet in the woods) so I'm extremely disappointed. I went back to my cracked screen Kindle during the outage, but the battery was almost dead and didn't last long.

But between being difficult to hold if you're a side reader and not functioning without internet connection renders it nearly useless for me. I much prefer my older Paperwhite.",4.0
967,"MAN, what a disappointment this product was! Seriously, if you've never gotten a Kindle, SAVE THE MONEY and--I don't know. Buy literally anything else. Here's why!

MIGRAINE-INDUCING FLASHING SCREEN
This was the dealbreaker here. I had many issues with this, which you'll see below, but this was the one that broke me. See, whenever I pressed the screen to turn a page, it flashed this ""photo-negative"" image EVERY TIME. I figured out how to solve that issue by turning off the settings button that makes the page refresh, but the issue is still there on every other function--it flashes when you move from function to function, it flashes when you go back from one function to another, and so on,. It's horrible and there was no way to stop that part.

NIGHTMARE TRYING HEAR MY AUDIBLE CONTENT - wouldn't recognize Bluetooth!
I have a ton of Audible audiobooks. As one does, I like to listen to them, and I was promised that the Paperwhite would easily do this, which made sense since Amazon owns Audible.

BUT NO! It wouldn't sync with my phone even after multiple restarts/resets, and then when *one time* it happened, the Paperwhite froze up the minute I took out my Bluetooth headphones and wouldn't move from page to page.

SCREEN SIZE
Okay, so they touted this product as having a bigger screen size, which is great, and I kept hearing about how it was like a paperback, blah blah. What it's really like is like HALF a paperback. This is annoying, because I'm actually a pretty fast reader and this would double tne number of page turns. I know that doesn't sound like a big deal, but over time, it gets very annoying.

NO COLORS FOR COVER ART
This is a real slap in the face for the artists who construct cover art for books, and it's also a pain for readers, because let's face it, that's a way we quickly scan a bunch of books to find one specific one. Like, ""Oh, it's the green one!"" The other thing is that the cover art and color *are part of the book's message and theme,* which is why those elements were chosen. Without the colors, the covers are actually hard to read--not a surprise, because *they're easier to read when they're in the colors they're designed to have.""

HARD TO OPERATE
It's literally a pain to operate. How you get from X to Y to Z is by no means intuitive -- I was having to do a lot of poking, random swiping, etc.

SLOOOOWWWW PPPPPAAAAGGGEEE RESPONSSSSEEE
Yeah, slow as heck. Half the time, I'd click on something and then click on it *again* because it didn't respond the first time. Then I'd get those delightful migraine flashes from the screen twice, because once wasn't enough, apparently.

WELCOME BACK TO THE NINETIES; WHERE'S MY PAGER?
Bottom line, this functioned like some really bad flip phone from the 90s. If this actually *were* the 90s, I guess I'd think this was cool, but not as cool as an actual paperback with the real cover art, and that didn't give me migraines when I turned the page.

But seriously, the sensitivity is a bit much.

- Bigger is better. I can now increase the font size without reducing the words per page, which is great for older eyes.
- USB-C fits either way
- Adjustable background (white to amber)
- Sync’ing cloud content is easy
- Typing and paging are slightly faster

Cons (minor, but there are a few)
- The power button protrudes slightly, so when I prop the kindle upright, it sometimes turns off.
- Sync’ing local content, if you have any, from your old Kindle is a bit time consuming.
- Even with the brighter screen and adjustable warmth, the gen 11 is still not as white as my old kindle. I have brightness on max and warmth on low. Its still a very clear screen, but I would prefer a pure white background.

982,"Was informed by amazon that my product would be quite late in arrival and they offered a refund. Device arrived but locked me out. Called customer service, they explained because I was given a refund the device would have a ""banner"" on their end, not allowing it to be registered. However, if I paid for it again it could be lifted. Was transferred to finance, repaid for it. Said banner was not lifted, transferred me to device support help. Now, I'm usually a patient person, I too work in IT and Customer Service, so I get what it can be like. But, the gentleman I spoke to was of no use and just repeatedly told me to turn on/off the device for an hour. When I requested to be transferred to a different customer service agent because we weren't understanding each other and I didn't want to be a * KaReN *, he insisted ""But, Ma'am I'm here to help you!"" and refused to transfer me. I wish I was joking... I hung up. I just couldn't.

So, while I have not yet been able to read a book, I assure you I'm well familiar with the ON/OFF button and the ""register your kindle"" page. The registering with your app seems cool and quick, IDK if it works or not. Wasn't for me for the reason mentioned above. Anywho, this is how I feel about the performances Amazon asked me for:

The TOUCH SCREEN is ok. I have no issues with the sensitivity and the grey/white takes some time to get used to but delivers on its' ""no glare"" claims. I rated the touch screen as a 1 star review though because it shows your keystrokes and remembers them for 2.5 - 3 seconds after clicking. So, if you're typing a password, even with a ""Hide Password"" box checked, if someone was over your shoulder, they'd know what your password is, definitely a security issue IMO.

2 stars for the EASY TO READ section. If its just your book page, its fine, probably a little lesser quality than what you envisioned but nothing to b*tch over. HOWEVER, coinciding with the touch screen thing.... If you type quickly between CAPITALS or !@#$%^ the letters overlap each other and it becomes hard to read. Think of old time TVs, where if you left it on a single image ""paused"" it'd burn into the screen and be there for a while. It's like that but without needing to take the 30 min to set in and it all happening at once so your keyboard could be reading with 3 letters on top of each other instead of 1.

The BATTERY LIFE is amazing, 5 stars, no cap as the kids say. This thing stayed turned on/illuminated on the 3 different screens I have seen thus far for the entirety of my 2.5 hour customer service call along with 30-40 minutes attempted set up time and only went from 98% to 95%. So while, I can't attest to 10 weeks in a single charge. The 3% for 120 minutes did strike me as quite impressive.",5.0

984,"TLDR: stupid power button placement and night mode is not fully functional.

I love reading on my kindle before bed…better than an iPad bc of the screen light. But there are two things I don’t like about this model. First, the power button being on the bottom is dumb. But this model is worse bc it protrudes so much.You can’t rest the kindle on a holder (like in a bathtub or on a countertop holder) bc it powers off. Seems like such an obvious oversight.

Second, this model allows for night mode with black background and white writing, which is better for night reading. EXCEPT when you change the page, it feels like it’s switching between normal and night mode, so you get a flash of brightness, which is the opposite of the point.

Hopefully they’ll fix these in the next model",5.0

998,"I ordered the Kindle Paperwhite with only 8 G of memory because I don't have nearly ""thousands of titles."" I assumed that the 8 G would be plenty for use with just a couple hundred books or so downloaded on the Kindle for my husband. I also got the Paperwhite specifically to be easier on the eyes while reading at night. I'm not so sure about the latter either, since it comes on really bright at night in reverse (black background) mode.

Apparently not so.

The device seemed to work fine for the first 3 months. (It was just a bit annoying because we are used to the Kindle app, and the actual Kindle works very differently and does not sync with the collections specified online.)

Now, at 3 1/2 months it freezes so much that it is really difficult to use. It's fine for reading in just one book, but switching from one book to another is nearly impossible.

I am SO DISAPPOINTED!!!

UPDATE: I deleted the downloads of maybe a couple dozen books, some of them really big, and the device works much better now. It's still abominably slow to search for and load books, though. And there were NOT ""several hundred books"" on the device. That's okay, because it's unlike that we'd need more than that away from wi-fi, or in a power outage, for that matter. But it's just annoying that Amazon would advertise that it would hold ""thousands of titles."" I think it's actually literally true: It holds thousands of *titles* - just the *titles* of ""thousands of books,"" not the content of thousands of books - not more than the content of a few dozen books. But the normal understanding of Amazon's description would be that the device actually stores the contents of ""thousands of titles."" Shame on Amazon for this exaggeration!",5.0

It has a ""WAKE UP"" mode for when it's off for quite a while; click the button and it goes from ""wake up"" to ""swipe to unlock"" and you're all set. I have noticed a huge increase in how long the power charge lasts which I love. The brightness is better than the old Kindle, also.

The best part is the instructions showed me how to get rid of 22 pages of ""group by author/series"" catalogs that came at the end of my books. Gosh, I HATED those, especially when the books I haven't read yet got mixed up in the bunch!!

Have had it for a 3 weeks now and am loving this little kindle. The battery life is extraordinary in my opinion; I have only needed to charge it once.

The size is perfect for me since I wanted something larger than a phone but smaller than a tablet to read on. Very lightweight and portable.

1008,"Got a new Kindle because my wife had slowly taken over my old keyboard version. I wasn't worried because I thought newer would be better, but it's anything but. The lack of buttons was a terrible idea as was the flush screen that covers the bezels. The fingerprints that this thing accumulates are horrendous. You can't really hold it without leaving fingerprints around the part of the screen that covers the bezels and the touch controls are finicky. I'll touch the right side of the screen which should trigger a page advance but it often goes in reverse instead. This often causes multiple taps to get what you want, leaving more finger prints. You basically have to bring a cloth with you everywhere you go to wipe them off.
The lack of buttons for page turns is a much bigger deal than I anticipated. I really miss the precision of the buttons and the ease of being able to hold the Kindle with one hand, thumb over the advance button. All it took was a bit of pressure to turn the page. I initially looked for a Kindle Keyboard when considering a new purchase, but discovered they had stopped making them. I really wish I had purchased a used one or had seen the Kobo Libra 2, as it also has physical buttons and bezels you can actually touch without leaving fingerprints.
My old Kindle is also faster. It starts up and navigates the menus faster than the new one. The new device also occasionally lags. You'll go to turn the page and nothing will happen. You'll tap it again thinking the first tap just didn't register. Maybe you tap it a third or fourth time. Then all of a sudden, it lurches back into action and registers all of the taps launching you forward several more pages than you intended. That may make sense in an app like Lightroom where you may be trying to adjust multiple files at once and have to wait for the device to catch up, but this is a book. You read a page, turn the page, and then take time to read the next page. You never get going fast enough to explain why the device lags so bad. I really feel like the new ones are a big step back in design.",5.0

1010,"I got my Kindle as a xmas gift in 2021 and I didn't use it much at all for the first 6-ish months of having it. I started using it more recently in the last few months and it worked great until yesterday. I last used it around a week ago when I finished another book and then again last night to start a new one and it gave me a low battery signal.

When I plugged it in to the same charger I always use it did not gain any battery and got extremely hot (only in the bottom right corner) where I was concerned that it would explode. It has since drained to the low battery screen in the picture and I have tried several charges, different wall outlets and battery packs but none of them seem to do anything to get it off of the low battery screen. The charge light at the bottom won't even turn on at this point.

I have attempted to do the hard reset on it with holding it for 40 seconds and it does nothing to reboot the device. It seems to permanently be stuck on the low battery screen.

I was able to trade my old one in and get an awesome discount too!

This kindle is lightyears better than the one from 2 generations ago. The yellow screen for night reading is really useful, the battery lasts forever, and the ability to display your book’s cover when the kindle is off is so cool.

The only things i don’t like are that it takes 2 presses to get to the settings whereas it used to just be 1 press. And i don’t like how they removed the dip in the screen, i thought that made it easier to hold the kindle. Also there’s no way to get rid of magazines that automatically add to your kindle from your amazon library (which sucks if you like things to be clean).

First, really quick, let me say what I don't like: it is heavier than previous generation, and the max brightness level sometimes doesn't seem bright enough in certain bright lighting. But these are minor and I still give 5 stars!

I love the larger screen, closer margins, warm light is amazing for night reading, the charging port is updated to the usb-c so I can now use one charger for all my devices, the page looks even more textured for a more book like paper appearance, and battery life still great in my opinion! I usually only have to charge it once a week, but being a mom I don't get to read very heavily (moderatley and mostly at night). The warm light can be put on an automatic schedule or it can be set and adjusted easily from drop down quick menu.

The biggest problem is there are shadows on the screen between the lines. It is as if the previous or next page is showing through the current page. Also since there is not a frame around the front of the screen it makes it harder to hold. Yes, the lack of the frame allows for more readable screen space but it also means that it is more slippery to hold and that I am regularly inadvertently turning the page because I am touching the screen. Also I HATE the new interface. What used to be a clean simple library where I could easily find my books is now overly busy and is designed to always be trying to sell me books. As with my previous paperwhite, the battery life is awesome. With Wi-Fi off I can go a month of daily reading without recharging.

Pros:
- Battery life. Lasts forever. I barely need to charge it.
- Backlight. You can read late at night without burning your eyes. It feels like reading a book.
- Water resistant. An always needed feature.

Cons:
- User Interface. As someone who grew up around technology and generally doesn't have issues, the UI is lacking. All of the options/navigation involving tapping or sliding from the top of the screen. The motions are all similar. There are no physical buttons, which adds to the difficulty.
- Lack or Accessibility Options. The Kindle has Bluetooth. There are plenty of Bluetooth page-turning devices on the market which are compatible with the Kindle app on iOS and Android, but on not the Kindle itself. Kindles currently only allow Bluetooth audio devices. This is a simple feature that would make the Kindle way more accessible.

1063,"this is my fourth or fifth Kindle and I purposely bought the new one thinking it would have the on-off button on the top - like my last one did. I was getting ready to return it because it is incredibly frustrating to have the bottom button when I want to eat and read, knit and read, etc. But from the comments it appears that you no longer offer a Paperwhite with a top button. So I will keep this one but I think it was a very bad decision - as you can see from other commenters - to discontinue the choice of a top on/off button. As you can see from my account, I have lots of experience buying and reading on my Kindles. A lack of choice is unacceptable.",4.0
1064,"It took me 28 days to go from a full charge to 10 percent, although I didn't use it some days but I'm really impressed and I would recommend you buy one if you're playing too much video games at night and want to sleep. Also when first unbox it it looks like a layer of thin plastic fill needs to be pulled off but don't do that because it's e ink and it's part of the screen. I wish the touch screen was faster but overall this is a good product.",4.0

It isn’t quite as ergonomic to hold as my previous one and I find myself accidentally turning pages often, which is a milder complaint. There is a method to temporarily turn off all touch screen functions except to swipe pages, however I’m not sure if it’s just me, but it takes several swipe just to turn page.

Overall, I am pleased with my purchase. The battery life is better, the screen a bit bigger, and I like that it is water resisted.",4.0

1070,"I’m no kindle noob, though it has been a few generations since I’ve purchased a new one

The response time to touch commands on this product is simple atrocious half the time. Gave it the benefit of the doubt that it might be upgrading, even nudged it along. Gave it the benefit of the doubt that it might be loading my library in the background so go it a rest. But even after it could squeeze no more cycles through the network the thing would respond at any level other that a book itself for probably 5-8 seconds, which is an eternity in touchscreen interface

Don’t get me wrong - I don’t expect phone or tablet responsiveness - the the basic speed of turning pages in a book really shouldn’t be that out of reach for the OS of a brand new reader",2.0
1071,"Had my old Kindle Paperwhite since 2014. It was lagging, and Prime Day seemed like a good time to upgrade. First off, not a fan of the menu. It's confusing and impossible to read without my reading glasses. I also much preferred the simpler light adjustment on the old one; seems like I can't get the lighting right on this one. The biggest issue is this one is buggy. It frequently restarts, and last week had a critical error that required a factory reset. Finally, it can't keep a wifi connection long enough to browse the Kindle store. (Amazon claims the problem is my router, which works fine with 13 other devices in my home.)",2.0
1072,I was used to my old kindle and don’t like the library and Home Screen display. I have a hard time locating my books but the reading is fine. I do lose my place while reading more often because my finger often touches the screen while I am reading and it goes forward or backward in the middle of the paragraph. I still prefer kindle reading to having to travel to the library to pick up or return books.,2.0
1073,"OK - Amazon starts out by asking, What did I use this product for...Guys, it's a reader. I didn't buy it to lay bricks.
Not my first Kindle, alas my old one (a Gen 3 Keyboard) finally died an ugly death; had to replace it, and can't even begin to say how much I miss it. The warm backlighting on this model is nice, I will admit, but that's the only thing I find to like. The software keeps cutting out at odd moments -- pages don't turn, it is needlessly, obnoxiously difficult to move from chapter to chapter, and the library concept should have died in the womb. It used to be a list, like for people who can read -- now it's a crappy, cumbersome clot of PICTURES -- I assume to assist the population subset of reader buyers who cannot actually read -- that takes forever (and a lot of excessive moves) to navigate through, and demands a whole lot of other unnecessary complications to do anything with. Amazon is following the same trajectory as other device producers, given time: degrade the basic product despite a couple nicer features, and ignore what worked for the customer in favor of what Amazon wants.",2.0
1074,"Overall, this is a good Kindle. I like the ""warm"" screen; easy on the eyes. The lock screen however is buggy. Entering the unlock code is slow because the Kindle is slow to respond to key presses. I've found the solution is to restart/reset the Kindle and after it restarts, then the lock screen works better---for a while, then it starts to slow again. Battery life is good and recharge time is very fast.",2.0

Fantastic product.,2.0
1077,"I am discovering that not all Kindle books are compatible with the Kindle Paperwhite. I will probably be returning this and sticking to Apple books unless Amazon can resolve the problem for me. THIS IS AN ADDENDUM THE DAY AFTER I WROTE THIS REVIEW. For the first time ever, I got a call back from Amazon about my review and my unhappiness. Together, the Amazon rep and I looked at the book in question. If you scroll down a little on the book page, there is a drop-down menu that says ""available devices."" Clicking on that menu revealed that the book, indeed, is not available on my Kindle device, but is available on Kindle Fire, various Kindle apps, and cloud reader. I appreciated the callback and recommended that where books are not available on all Kindle devices, that is communicated in a more obvious way. I was impressed with Amazon's callback, but I can't go all the way to a 4 or 5-star review until I see that some changes have been made.",2.0

I set mine for dark mode which is really easy on the eyes. It’s simple enough to use. I thought the ads would be annoying but they aren’t. The size is nice and the battery last a long while. The only down side is the library view only shows 6 books at a time, this can take forever to scroll through if you have lots of books. Also the browsing function for books is not user friendly. I tried to find some books for my daughter on the kindle paperwhite and I could filter through them adequately. Finding new books is just easier on the app or website. Very happy I have it and would recommend to others.",2.0

1083,"I am not as impressed as I was prepared to be. The touch screen is mediocre at best. Scrolling down, while reading the tutorial, it jumped over some areas and you have to tediously ease the screen to the proper position. Page turning is another subject. You can touch the screen heavily or lightly, and sometimes it will turn 1 page and sometimes 2-4 pages. It’s annoying trying to find your place again. I do not use the paper white to search for books on Amazon, it’s too frustrating. I search for books, read reviews, and back covers using the kindle app on my cell phone. It says it has a 10 week battery life but perhaps that is if you don’t use it to read. I have had it for maybe two weeks and I’ve charged it no less than 3 times but I think I have read 4-5 books during that time on it. So maybe I have above average usage. I have not tested the waterproof property yet.",5.0

1098,"I had the last version and this is a nice upgrade. Like the slightly larger size, very easy to read and like the new lighting options as well as the longer battery life. But there are a couple default settings I think should be changed. One is you see the popular highlights shown in a book, and in my opinion that should be off by default. I would think most people would want that off. The other option I liked was the new page turn animation. I stumbled across it by accident and it is off by default, I really think that should be on. It is found by, when reading a book, tap the top edge of the screen and then tap the font symbol ""Aa"" and then tap ""More"" and then scroll down and you'll see it. I liked it more than I expected and I really believe that should be on by default, as I believe most people would like that on as well.",5.0

It had buttons on both sides of the screen so you could flip pages forward or backward with either hand without moving your fingers, just a little squeeze. Now I can only flip forward on the right, back on the left, giving less options for how I hold the kindle. And it sometimes flips two pages, so you have to keep an eye out for skipping pages. Also, I don’t like that I have to touch the screen, because now I have to clean my greasy little fingerprints off of it all the time (from lotion, snacks, and just being a human).

- USB-C is a nice touch
- software is pretty good for a e reader
- tons of storage for books
- Kindle Unlimited is a must have
- The ads on the homescreen are not that bad

I currently own a Iphone 12 pro max. On paper the screen size doesn't look like a big upgrade, put in person the screen on the kindle is much more wider and the bezels make it easier to hold; not to mention that a E-ink display is a lot better for your eyes and puts less strain.

My only real complaint is with the most recent software update that has restructured the home page. The ability to scroll and that the titles are a little smaller is appreciated. However, I really hate that there's no longer a toggle between downloads/full library. You can still do it via the filters, but it's such an unnecessary extra step when I get a new book I'm trying to download. All of the other improvements are wonderful.",5.0

Other than connecting to the internet to download books, I keep it on airplane mode and the brightness is usually between 3-7. I read 2-5 hours a day, more if I’m not working or doing anything. The fact that after 4 weeks, I only used half the battery life is fantastic.

The page turning and time it takes to load things is far quicker than the previous paperwhite and even a little better than the Oasis.

1133,"Pluses: The new Kindle has a very sharp screen, is light and comfortable to hold, ""wakes up"" easily when I open my case and preserves a charge nicely when I close it.
Neutrals: pictures in grayscale are definitely sharper, but do we really need 300 dpi type for reading? Also, I prefer using a narrow column, so the additional width is wasted on me.
Negatives: Alas, the modern Kindle fails in its basic task, which is to be easier on the eyes than a modern tablet or computer, no matter how many shades of 17 diode light or mango I apply. I can download a Kindle Reader app on any of them plus my phone and read at least as easily. My very old Keyboard Kindle actually had a much softer presentation, back when computers really hurt to read on.
Second problem (software) is that highlighting text tends to take long to ""grab"" and sometimes brings down the preference screen instead.
Third: I purchased the bundle, and I am not aware that the nine volt charger really charges much faster than the five.

Second, it doesn't fully rotate and thus if you place it in a case it's only useful to open the case from one direction. If you're left-handed and want to open the case from the other direction or hold it with the other hand than is the usual, then without full rotation the Paperwhite device never reads correctly.

1156,"I’m absolutely disappointed. I’ve been using a prior version of paperwhite for seven years and absolutely love it. It’s just the perfect size and weight for me to hold on one hand to read at bed before sleeping. My old kindle unfortunately broke down and I didn’t think twice before buying a new paperwhite. However I was sad to find that paperwhite is not the same anymore. Its bezel gets so thin and with the flush screen it’s just very hard to hold it tightly on one hand without accidentally touching the screen. I know we can lock the touch screen but that doesn’t solve the issue for me as when I’m holding it on one hand I can’t make a long enough swipe to turn page - I don’t have large enough hands! Then I try to use landscape mode to hold the thickest bezel while reading but that can’t be done either - the landscape mode only allows one direction, and it’s the wrong direction - meaning, if I want to hold the side of the thicker bezel with my right hand, the words would be upside down. After so many attempts I just got so angry with Amazon. Why do they have to do this to my fav paperwhite. Why I does every digital divice HAVE TO have larger screen? I just don’t see the point. Now I have to return this uncomfortable to hold kindle and buy a new one and just lose all the prime day discount (I made my original purchase on prime day, I should’ve purchased a smaller kindle that day ugh). I’m very dissatisfied with the stupid upgrade of 2021 paperwhite. I hate the thin bezel and slippery back and the larger size and heavier weight and the flush screen. I hate basically every upgrade Amazon made to the outlook of paperwhite. I really just hope I can get the old paperwhite back.",5.0

I was able to find the book I had been reading on my old Kindle (it died after five years of heavy use), but the discovery was by chance.

The former manual keys for advancing or retreating pages are gone. There are no keys at all. Everything is touch screen. For someone like myself with Carpal-Tunnel Syndrome, this can be difficult. I'm getting used to it.

1187,"Hi everyone,
so I'm a voracious reader and have at least a thousand books on my kindles. I actually own 3, all synced together because I travel a ton and keep one in my travel bag. I stays on my nightstand and one is at the office. All 3 are the paperwhite models. I really have loved them. Anyway, I get this model as soon as it came out. It has some strange hang ups, like when I step away for a bit and it goes into sleep mode or close the cover, and when I return and swipe to turn it on, it goes to a page between 50 and 100 pages back, so then of course I have to search for where I was. It's extremely annoying and my 2 other kindles have not done this. There is no option that says return to the last page read or something like that. This is driving me crazy. Anyway, yesterday it completely froze. So of course I pushed and held the power button to restart it. I did this and it came back on eventually but frozen to the scene with the boy reading against the tree. I can't get past this. I tried to restart it and it does nothing. I tried plugging it in to the power cable and still nothing. It is charged to about 40%. I called customer service and after about 30 MINUTES trouble shooting, they said they would process the return and exchange for a new one, but that it would come in 3 days. I don't understand why the delay. I'm in the hospital and literally have nothing to do because I only love to read in my free time. I don't watch tv and can't read on my phone for hours because it's not comfortable, which is why I have 3 kindles and also it depletes my phone battery.
Anyway, after explaining all this to the rep, they said they would ask a lead about giving me some kind of compensation (anything) because of the inconvenience. He then said he would have to get back to me the next day. I got an email from amazon regarding the issue but it didn't say anything about the resolution, so I had to call them again. And finally they said they can't do anything because they had processed the exchange, as if they were doing me a favor, when it has a year warranty and I got it at the end of october. Thus it's totally under warranty and therefore they have to replace it because it's defective. Honestly this whole experience has left me with such a bad taste that I'm actually considering canceling my prime membership. Stay clear is my recommendation and avoid both Amazon and their products because they are not what they used to be, both in quality and customer service.",5.0

1209,"While this Kindle Paperwhite 2021 finally brings a whole host of long needed improvements, the likes of which competitor Kobo has offered for years and at various price points, it’s not without its flaws.

For starters the overall footprint of the device has increased despite room enough to fit the larger 6.8” display within the footprint of the former body. While it’s not a deal breaker it hurts portability and single-hand use that little bit. The latter is especially noticeable because, unlike it’s pricier sibling the Oasis, it lacks an asymmetric grip and page turn buttons.

While the resolution of the new display is the same 300 PPI, I encountered noteworthy issues with display sharpness when compared to the 2018 model. As pictured (to the best of my ability) my new model lacks sharpness and contrast all around the edges and in particular on the left side which results in a soft almost fuzzy lack of crispness to all text or images.

To make matters worse the consistency of this issue varies wildly across the display. In the image you can almost make out the random diagonal plane of sharpness towards the center of the display. This means that you find yourself consistently reminded how soft the fuzzy portions are compared to the properly sharp portions.

I’m thrilled to see Amazon finally include USB-C and warm-light adjustment, but I find it especially hard to look past the display issues on a device expressly built for reading. If you have the previous generation Kindle Paperwhite or Oasis I’d recommend holding off for now or consider a Kobo equivalent model with native OverDrive support for library borrowing.",5.0

1217,"I have bought many KIndles through Amazon over the years and this will be my last purchase. I am an Amazon prime member and Amazon usually does not disappoint, However, in this case I would suggest buyers look into the Nook or some other e reader for the following reason:

My Paperwhite which I bought in 2013 broke. I needed to repair it for a host of complex reasons, the main one being that I can not use a new one to transfer my information because it involved Amazon China which Amazon US has now pulled out of - no more e books etc in China.

So I attempted to get Amazon to help me fix this Kindle which needs a battery replacement. I understand it is out of warranty so I said I was more than happy to pay for it. No, they will not do repairs unless it is in warranty! Who ever heard of such a thing? If my dish washer breaks down will they tell me they can not do any repairs because it is out of warranty? Of course not. One just has to pay for the repairs as opposed to having them covered.

Then I gave up on that route and just decided to ask a supervisor what battery I needed so I could buy it myself and the supervisor refused to give me that information, as thought it were some top secret, classified information. He said that I should get a new Kindle and they give a slight discount towards that. I explained to him how that does not solve my problem but he clearly did not care and refused to give me the battery information..

Afterwards I found out that it is quite easy to find out what battery the Kindle paperwhite 2013 takes just by googling it and I was able to buy the battery and a repair kit online and I will try to do it myself.

1222,"This is a great reading device - when it works. As a few other reviewers mentioned, it will often freeze up. You get a warning that it’s going to happen because the page turns get slower and slower; there’s a palpable and annoying delay before the page finally turns, which then leads to a complete freeze up. There is absolutely no choice except to reboot it entirely. This would be great, but this problem is it’s fatal flaw.

UPDATE: The very next day after this review was posted, I received a call regarding my negative review from an Amazon Outreach Support Representative. She patiently and professionally guided me through performing a factory reset and creating a new Amazon account. This took awhile due to my continual errors in doing so. The representative was very polite and kind and was dedicated to resolving the problem. Now my PaperWhite is functioning flawlessly. Not only do the pages now turn easily but I noticed that now the battery lasts significantly longer. Thanks to this representative and the now perfect functionality of my Kindle, I find it reasonable to upgrade my review to five stars.

Update number 2: I now must return to my original review. It IS a piece of junk. I was just in the middle of reading a book when the entire screen went blank. I had to restart it twice and went to a different page rather then the page on which I was reading. I would give this one star except that it works most of the time; nevertheless, this is extremely annoying, frustrating, and interferes with the joy of reading. There is no reasonable explanation to why this happens.

Update #3: I had previously mentioned that the Paperwhite was freezing frequently again. That is no longer an issue because it just died. Nothing I tried worked. So now it’s a Paperweight. This is truly a cheap and pathetic ereader. Amazon should be ashamed of itself but I know that they couldn’t care less, I.e. too big to fail. This Kindle gets stellar reviews but just wait until you’ve had it awhile. If it doesn’t crap out eventually, consider yourself lucky and buy a lottery ticket.

Well, it does offer them but they are not sufficient. The screen size is small (smaller than what I anticipated from the description) the font size does not get very large, certainly not large enough, and the font options are terrible, all with a script, no sans script (which is So much easier to read with vision problems) and they are all hard to read with poor vision. I am very disappointed, and may have to return. I will give it a try to see if I can make it work. I do think it could be a good option for someone else, without visual impairment.

Update: I wrote the previous in frustration, which I still have, albeit waning. They do, actually, have sans script but it (clearly) was hard to tell the difference., and only have a few style options (maybe 8). Directly following this review, I received a phone call from Amazon. They sent me info on how to change font, etc, which I already had done. My issue seems to be this: this machine can hold thousands of books which can be downloaded in seconds each, yet the font size only goes up to a small size. I would think that the font size could be adjusted for those of us with very low vision. In researching this product, i read the font could get ‘huge’, a selling point, but no, it can’t.

I am reading far more than 20 minutes per day and getting far more battery life than advertised. Something more like 20 days than 10 days.

Also really love being able to read in bed with no light. It’s been 2 months and I think I’m officially to the point where I would have difficulty sleeping without it.",5.0

1233,"3 pm today I'm enjoying my Kindle Paperwhite. (Purchased November 25, Today is May 25.) Finished my book and had some other stuff to do so I plugged it in to the charger and walked away. Purchased a new book from my desktop computer around dinner time, but didn't pick up my Kindle again until around 11 pm tonight. Hmm...no new book. Hit the sync button. Still no new book. Hold the power button and wait for the dialogue box to pop up and select ""Restart"". And that's the last thing it ever did.

The screen flashes like it's attempting to reboot, but the only thing it displays is the Kindle logo with the boy reading under a tree. Every so often it'll flash again, but it never progresses further. Support tells you to hold the power button down for 40 seconds to force a restart, but there's no different result. Then they tell you to try it again with various options for plugging it in (try a different charger, try a usb port on your computer, nope...plug it back into a wall charger.) Nothing makes it respond differently. I can't even shut it off. There's another review posted by Nishan with a video of the exact same thing happening. Amazon is sending a replacement, but it's going to be a refurbished model which I'm not exactly happy about. It's probably going to be one that somebody sent back that's got the same exact problem.

This worked beautifully when it worked. My favorite Kindle by far, and it did respond a lot better than my 2018 version. But if I only get 6 months out of it, it's hardly worth the purchase price and the hassle of needing to return it. If it weren't for my raging insomnia I'd swear off Kindle all together. (Different models, but I've had to replace at least 2 others over the years for weird software/hardware issues similar to this.) Unfortunately, being able to read in the dark without waking up my husband means I'm tied to these.",5.0

Mostly I’ll be reading and suddenly I’m on another page. So used to it now I just automatically page forward twice and I’m back where I should be.

Called and chatted for help several times but the ""customer service"" kept pushing me to the next person. Most likely they had no idea what to do either. Tried questions in the forum but looked like everyone had issues with it. After 2 weeks finally got everything figured out. Took numerous reboots, updating, and cursing. Finally had to send everything one at a time from my account which was a very unpleasant experience.
They force you to keep the ""Home"" screen on it which I hate. There was an option to take it off but not after the update. It's nice enough now that it finally works but if the wifi hadn't gone out and the 3G cut off with my last one I would have kept that one and returned this one. The screen does look larger, closer to an actual page. And the battery keeps it's charge pretty well. My last one had started running down more quickly. Do like the ""warmth schedule"" for reading at night. Looks less harsh and doesn't mess with my eyes as much. Overall a really bad beginning that colored my view of this device.

1274,"THE BEZELS ARE WAY TOO THIN!

The bezels are the black border around the Kindle that you can safely touch without turning the page.

The product picture demonstrates the problem. The hand-model's thumb while holding the Kindle is in an awkward position. Your thumb will normally be at an angle in line with the angle of your index finger behind the Kindle, not straight up and down like the hand model's thumb. But you CAN'T PUT YOUR THUMB AT AN ANGLE BECAUSE THE BEZELS ARE TOO THIN AND IF YOU DO THE PAGE WILL TURN.

I've used Kindle e-readers for close to a decade. This was a Christmas gift that I was excited to receive, but found it almost unusable.

E-readers are held in two different ways:
(1) LIGHT-GRIP -- HOLDING IT LIKE A DINNER PLATE: When you're sitting in a chair or at a table and you know you don't need to keep the e-reader from falling out of your hand you hold it with a LIGHT GRIP like you're holding a dinner plate. Your thumbs and fingers are barely brushing the side because gravity is doing the work of keeping the kindle in your hand. In this situation the bezels don't matter.

(2) FIRM GRIP -- HOLDING IT LIKE A FRISBEE (aka flying disk): for all other occasions and ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE HOLDING IT WITH ONLY ONE HAND or reading at night while lying in bed you hold it with a FIRM GRIP which means your thumb needs to be somewhere on top of the screen. With the older kindles this was easy to do because the bezels were wide enough that you could rest your thumb and not worry about turning the page. WITH THIS KINDLE IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO HOLD IT WITH A FIRM GRIP AND NOT TURN THE PAGE.

Very disappointed. I expect a trillion-dollar company like Amazon to hire designers who actually use the product.",5.0

At first, I was concerned with how much bigger it seemed, but I love its size - it's not too big, but the increase in screen size is wonderful. However, after only a few weeks, it's already behaving similar to my previous kindle, though not nearly as grindy. For example, when my battery is above 50% or so, the page turns smoothly and quickly, but as soon as the battery gets a little lower, when I turn the page the entire screen flashes white before flipping to the new page. I'm surprised and disappointed by how little Amazon did to improve this new Kindle.",5.0
1278,"Update: I'm taking away one more star, down to 3. The software is worse than I initially thought. Every now and then, when I try to turn the page, it freezes. After a few more tries, 30 seconds later, it unfreezes and reacts to all those page turns, forcing me to go back several pages until I find my place again

Overall a very nice reader, nicer than my old Kindle Paperwhite 7th Generation
They keep advertising ""10 weeks of battery life"", which is meaningless. I wish they advertised how many hours one can read on a battery charge. I see no evidence that the battery lasts longer than the old one, plus it depends on how bright I make the backlight. With the way I have mine set up, I get about 30 hours of reading
They made the display bigger by making the bezel narrower, but that also causes a major problem, at least for me. The way I usually hold it, my fingers are on the back, supporting the weight, and my thumb is on the bezel, providing the balance. With the narrower bezel, this causes inadvertent page turns, which is extremely annoying. The good news is that this problem can probably be fixed through a software update, by adding half an inch of guard band (i.e. a region that ignores finger touches) at the left and right edges (excluding the top corners, which have special functions)",5.0

The device is great, don't get me wrong. The material its made of makes holding it feel natural, the screen is excellent (although the voyage remains the sharpest screen to date) and I enjoy the size increase. But many small things have just come together to really annoy me.

For starters, the device freezes on a regular basis usually after adjusting font/brightness and returning to the book. Sometimes it unfreezes after a bout 20 seconds sometimes it never does. I've had the device a few days but its happened almost a dozen times. I thought my issues would be over when I updated the firmware but that not only didnt help, but introduced a new bug where the backlight does not turn off when locking the device, and made some nonsense changes to the interface. List view went from 7-8 books to 5. For those with a big library, that makes it very painful to view everything (and nothing has been added to the value of the list view, same data just unnecessarily bigger. Why not leave the option for fitting more books in the list?)
The power button is on the bottom. I've accidentally turned my device off while reading many times considering that the larger form factor requires cradling on my fingers at times. Curious placement. I've tried to remove special offers but for three days now it just says ""sorry something went wrong, please try again later"". My kindle is a place where I go to get away from everything else, not be advertised to. After this bug I researched the issue and other people are being told that they aren't allowed to remove ads. That's disappointing.

I know it sounds nitpicky, but a great device has just been crippled with strange bugs, unusual design choices and software updates that don't really add value and seem to just be changing things for the sake of changing things, or changing things for the wrong reasons. For the first time in my life after owning kindles for ten years, I'm considering returning it.",3.0

1303,"In the past, Amazon was a company you could count on to continually innovate to find ways to provide great things for its customers. With its enormous market share, it is now turning into a company, like Apple, that narrows its customers' options and forces them into buying its substandard products. I was very happy, for example, with the Kindle app for Android, and have been buying many more Kindle books than I ever purchased in paper. But now Amazon has discontinued its Kindle app for newer Android devices. I've come to rely on eBooks so much that I needed an alternative. It seemed that the best alternative was to buy a Kindle. I first purchased a Kindle Fire and was disappointed with the glare on the screen and the short battery life. So, I then purchased a Kindle Paperwhite (11th ed.) The battery life is better, and the text is very readable, but the contrast for images is washed out and there is no way to adjust the contrast. But the worst thing for me is that the Text-to-Speech function is now gone. I commute to work and enjoyed listening to books. It is still possible to do so on the Paperwhite, but you either have to pay extra for an Audible version of the book, or you need to use the Accessibility feature for blind people which is extraordinarily clunky. It reads everything on the screen, is a first-generation voice (sounds more digital), and is very difficult to navigate. It is impossible to switch back and forth very quickly. You must navigate through multiple menus to turn the feature on and off, including turning your password off every time you use the feature. I have now spent hundreds of dollars trying to find the best alternative to the Kindle app for Android, which worked perfectly. Of course, I'm sure Amazon is very happy about this since I've been forced to buy more of its products in order to do what I was formerly able to do for no additional cost.

Secondly, it is difficult to get some e-arcs sent to the kindle itself. It’s a tedious procedure and can get frustrating. Thirdly, some of the covers don’t show up, specifically for e-arcs, so it can be tough to tell which book I’m clicking on in my library. Fourthly the touch screen doesn’t always pick up when it’s being touched. Also, it will often freeze on me.

Anyways, ended up buying the new version for full price ($130) and after few weeks of usage, don't see any material upgrade from 2018 version, and therefore don't see it worth the high price.

1328,"I have owned two Kindles prior to buying this one: Paperwhite (2015) and Kindle 4. Kindle 4 still remains my favorite all around e-reader. In retrospect, I really liked having a non-touch screen. The downside of Kindle 4 was that it was slow and I couldn't read in the dark. The Paperwhite (2015) was an improvement over that mainly because now I could read in the dark. The touch screen added a bit of ease of use but annoyance with every touch being an interaction. Still, I told myself that if Amazon added warm light and a USB-C to the Paperwhite, I would buy it. So I bought this one.

And really, those two features are the two big steps forward for this device. It also feels faster than my Paperwhite 2015 so that doesn't hurt either. The downside for this device is that now with the flush screen and smaller bezels, the touch sensitive area is even bigger. I had too many unintended touches on this device. It's also a little bit bigger; so with small bezels all around, it's just generally less uncomfortable to hold. This was the least comfortable kindle I have had.

I also typically keep my device on airplane mode unless I need to connect to my Amazon account. This device froze frequently while I was reading. I suspect this has to do with telemetry and ads being pulled to the device. In airplane mode, the device just freezes and lags if it can't communicate with Amazon servers. This is just my guess but I have seen this behavior in games in both iOS and Android platforms where if you block their access to the internet, the games lags heavily and once you restore internet access, the game play is smooth again.

So generally, this is a good step forward for Amazon. I suspect that Amazon is expanding its ads business and the integration of that into the kindle OS is causing lags on the device when in airplane mode. That's definitely a step backwards. Add to that a bigger device that is less comfortable to hold and the choice was clear for me.

I am sending this device back and keeping my Paperwhite 2015.",5.0

1333,"Right out of the box, I hate it. I have a 3rd generation Kindle that I bought in 2011 and I have almost 600 books in it. It still works great, the battery charges and lasts for days. All the buttons still work, the screen and cover are in perfect condition. That's 10 great years, and I am an avid reader!
So you may wonder why I bought this new Kindle Paperwhite. Well, I live in the mountains of the Pacific Northwest and the power goes out quite often in the winter. I like to dive under the covers to stay warm and read, but when it gets dark, the old Kindle has no light. That is the one and only reason I got the new Paperwhite; so I can read during power outage.
The Paperwhite has a very thin frame so I can't hold it without touching the screen. So that is awkward since I have to move my thumb to read under it.
I absolutely hate the touch screen; it is very difficult to navigate and does not always respond when I ""tap"" or ""swipe"" and the screen gets fingerprints and smears. I like the navigation buttons and keyboard on the old Kindle.
The Paperwhite will stay in the bedside drawer until the lights go out. It works for that.",5.0

1337,"I bought this Kindle last March (2022) after my original 3G Kindle was discontinued. Read a lot on my old iPad with the Kindle app. Started using this new Paperwhite in the past few months with increasing problems. I turn a page and the whole screen turns white and crashes. Have to restart it multiple times. Looked online and saw that it may be a battery problem, so diligent about charging. Now crashing almost daily / nightly even though it's 90% + charged. Sometimes I turn the page and it looks like there are several pages superimposed on each other, then the inevitable white screen and multiple tries to restart. Not a pleasant reading experience. Can I exchange it for a new one?

Update: Contacted Amazon and they wanted me to sent my glitchy Kindle in to ""be fixed""., would take about a week. I asked them how I was supposed to read, said I would buy a new Kindle and send the old one back for refund. They finally agreed to send me a new one (said reconditioned on the package in Spanish, not English) and gave me 6 weeks to send in my glitchy one. The new Kindle is light-years different than the one I purchased in March 2022. I could not pick up that Kindle without turning several pages, even in a cover, and just read another person's review about the thin bezel: thought it was just me.
So far no more frozen white screens, having to restart it several times in a row. Fingers crossed!

None of that matters though if you get frustrated and just quit reading because it’s kicking you out or jumping to a new chapter.

I can read and listen simultaneously on my Samsung phone, iPad, or laptop,(or evev my daughters kindle fire); which leads to the 1st reason for a 2☆ rating.

2nd, I am dyslexic and sometimes I don't want to deal with my own slow reading. I also have an auditory Processing Disorder, which sometimes make me hear words incorrectly. A lot of time these two learning disability & Disorder go hand in hand.

What is wrong with having page turners that you click forward or backward as opposed to touch screen. I am used to being able to switch hands on my kindle. Now if I need to turn a page forward with my left hand, I have to cross my body to do so. And as long as we are on the subject of turning pages, what is with this new kindle white with going either forward or backward several chapters every time you power down. When you get back to your book, you can't tell where you are. Plus I used to be able to move my books into different categories, like Already Read, Good Books, Save for Next Books. If I add a book to the Already Read category now, it still sits there in my ""Library"". I do not delete books for any reason although some do end up being archived to Amazon's cloud. And what is with this nonsense of purchasing a book, but it doesn't download to your kindle. Instead of downloading a new book, just the title downloads and you have to manually check the internet connection, then check the airplane mode. Even then any other books you have just purchased do not get downloaded at the same time as the one you are wanting to read. I think my last rant is the way this thing lists your books. Either it is a picture with the title and author, or a list with the title and author and some other stuff that just takes up space that I would rather have for the list of my available books to read. This darn thing downloaded every title I have ever bought. All 596 of them. I am sure that most of these were archived. Is that stupid or what! What do I like about the kindle white? I can adjust the size of the letters to what I prefer.

1379,"I have a beloved fifth generation Kindle that has seen more than it's share of books. Receiving notice it would no longer be updated with new software and security, I purchased this one which arrived the day it was released. Big mistake. I had to update the software as soon as I received it.

I downloaded a few books in my library for a plane trip - they would not open on the airplane & I kept getting a message I needed to sign into Wi-Fi. Why? The books were already downloaded.

When I got to my destination I was able to open a book. For some annoying reason the word ""highlights"" appeared over certain sentences. Where they came from & how to remove them was a complete mystery until I read a review here from Sarah. After following her instructions I was able to get rid of highlights that others reading the same book had placed. Why would I want to see others highlights, Amazon? Even worse, it appears this procedure will have to be done for each book. Why should I have to edit highlights out of my books?

Further, I sorted the books in my 5th Gen nto categories, making them easy to locate when I wanted to read a certain genre. Where did they go? Why didn't they transfer somewhere I could find them?

So many reviewers are mentioning warmth, display, brightness, etc., as problems. All I want is to be able to find the books I already had in my library. And I want them in the way I sorted them, not the way Amazon is now presenting them, which is by series.

Screen responsiveness is sluggish. I often have to tap it repeatedly to turn a page or activate an icon.

Books don't automatically download when you purchase them anymore. Only the book cover shows up in your library, and you have to tap on that to initiate the full book download. If you fail to do so, and find yourself somewhere without Internet access, you will be unable to download and read your new books.

The “Remove this sample” option in the book-cover menu seldom works. In order to delete those samples, you have to go to through six screens in Settings to access Manual Removal in Storage Options. Good luck remembering which sample you wanted to delete by the time you get there.

“Remove download” used to remove the item from your device. Now, the book cover remains on your device. Downloaded items have check marks to distinguish them from the downloads you removed, but the book covers remain in either case. Now you have books covers for items that aren't downloaded cluttering up your library.

The device is too large to fit neatly into my hand like its predecessors did.

I was so excited for the next book from my author to come out for my feb birthday and buy on my Christmas kindle. I’ve already preordered from Amazon the hardcover.

UPDATE: I'm downgrading my original 5 star review to 3 stars. All of the above remarks still hold true BUT I am now having a huge, annoying problem turning the page. I find that instead of turning to the next page the Kindle, in it's infinite wisdom, will sometimes forward 2 or 3 pages ahead (while with some books this may be a blessing I would like to be the one that makes that choice). I am seriously considering going back to my old, smaller Paperwhite for a less frustrating read!

1404,"I very rarely review products, especially a crappy one. This one however, isn't okay. I bought mine back in January (not even 6 months ago) brand new for $130. I have been a long time Nook user. I've been having an issue with viewing a regular screen so I figured if I was going to purchase an e-reader and not a tablet-esqu one, I might as well go with Amazon for Kindle Unlimited as using my library apps seemed complicated. From the beginning, I had odd issues and just thought it was an inferior product because it was just an e-reader and nothing fancy. Sometimes my books just wouldn't download. No biggie. I then noticed my Kindle quit saving at the right place. Sometimes a page or two behind or sometimes chapters behind. I have the Kindle app on my phone and even though I don't really read on my phone anymore, thought maybe the two were just interfering with each other. I got over it. About two weeks ago, I was trying to download books and I was getting an application error. I thought maybe it was my wifi. I literally just kept figuring it was quirky and an e-reader... Now, last night, I got the page with the tree and person and it literally just keeps rebooting that screen every 15-20 seconds. It's been doing this for the past 24 hours. I can't just hold the button for 45 seconds and looking it up...it appears MANY people have had this issue and it's to do with the software. I did nothing to it. It ""lives"" in the side pocket of my daughter's nursery glider because I read it at night when I'm up with her. From what I read, most people are either offered to buy a new one for like $80 or they are told nothing can be done if there's no warranty. I do not have a warranty but I'm not dishing out another $80 to Amazon for the same product to break again. I'll be calling Customer Service tomorrow but judging from all the forums online, they'll use tech speak and then tell me nothing can be done. Even people WITH a warranty are simply being given refurbished ones after promised a new replacement...some already broken upon arrival. I REALLY expected better from the Kindle line.

Basic reading is not a lot of touches/clicks, so response time is fine. (Page turns seem as fast as physical book page turns). Battery life is more than enough.

Restarted the kindle twice, still nothing. Decided to reset the kindle and go through all the steps to set it up again. Still nothing. Called Amazon support and went through all the same steps and they concluded that I got ANOTHER damaged kindle within a two week time span. They recommended I get another replacement, which would be the third one in such a short time span or upgrade and get the Oasis. Asked for a discount for the Oasis, due to the inconvenience and the price difference. The answer was no. I understand that damaged items happen, but to get 2 back to back kindles within a short time span was not noted.

The delay between page turns is infuriating. I've had two of this version and both had the same problems (I returned the first for a replacement.) The touch screen is unresponsive and if you disable touch, the Kindle just freezes. Read some of the 1,2 and 3 star reviews, they mention the touch screen but don't deduct for what I think is the main reason for purchasing a Kindle, readability. I think this model has some inherent defects that show up immediately in some of those shipped, but might take a while to develop in others.

Amazon customer service has become abysmal and they have a ""New"" policy where they will replace your defective kindle for a $15 fee. They offered me half price for a refund, but ultimately said they would replace it for free, then instead of replacing it, they sent a repair order. When I questioned them, they said it was the best they could do.

I hate using this device, but I'm stuck with it. Everything about Amazon has gone down hill rapidly and this Kindle and their deteriorating customer service are just more examples.

1458,As a Kindle owner for many years (I’ve had several others before this one.) I must say that the Kindle Paperwhite (11th generation) “improvements” are not what they should be. Purchased new books and accessing the ones you already have purchased is not the simple task that Kindle is known for. Just holding this version by either side while reading can cause it to flip to other pages than the one you are reading. It is also very easy to turn it off by accident. Another issue comes up if you need to go to another part of a book as the new feature for this does not work very well. I shouldn’t have to sit with my finger pressed on the spot for an extended time to get it to respond. All in all I’m wishing I had my old Kindle back.,5.0
1459,"I’ve had multiple kindle paper whites over the years and while I have loved the convenience of them over having to buy physical books, the screen backlight has always bothered me. The 10th generation was horrible and there was a ton of blue light so reading at night was not the most enjoyable. When I saw this new version coming out, I was excited that it looked like they had finally fixed my number one complaint. This thing is amazing! If you have an old version, it is worth trading in and upgrading if you have a similar complaint. I love that you can adjust the warmth and the screen is slightly bigger as well. So glad I made the switch.",5.0

1463,"This is much faster than my previous Paperwhite. The page illumination is impressive, very uniform and no bright / dark spots at all. However, while the larger screen is appreciated, the increase in weight is substantial making the device hard to hold in one hand for a longer period. While very long battery life is important for some, it adds a lot of weight. Maybe reducing battery capacity could cut weight somewhat ? Also, holding the device is cumbersome. It is hard to hold on the wider bottom frame section, while side frames are too thin for holding. You need big hands to hold it in one hand. Amazon, just switch to the Oasis design for all of your devices, reduce the price, problem solved.",5.0

Sadly, now only 4 months later the battery will not charge fully. Yes, I tried various chargers and blocks and it never chargers past 85%. I read daily for about an hour and within 2 days the batteries are completely drained. So we are talking a 2 -3 hour battery life. I doubt this kindle will last me a decade.

The screen is VERY noticeably dimmer (on the highest setting) and I tended to use the highest on bright days.
The temp setting is ok but not reason to switch
The screen is already covered in fingerprints, my old one I never had that issue.
The texture of the screen is very different, the older one actually felt like the texture of paper, this is smooth, and a less pleasant tactile experience (thus the finger prints).

Ive only read a little so far, still waiting on the cover to arrive (picked up the bundle) and even my older one really disliked it without the cover much harder to hold on to.

Im hoping my opinion will change as I get a bit more into using it, and if it does I will update this.

The sensitive touch screen is worse now that you have less bezel to hold it, so you are constantly accidentally touching the screen causing it to page forward or back.

You can listen to your Audible books, however, you can’t read the book while you’re listening to it. Are you serious? This is 2023!!! You can Whispersinc across multiple devices but you can’t listen and follow along on the Paperwhite? Amazon owns both Audible and Kindle but you can’t do both at the same time on their device.

All our previous Kindles had a charger. In general, this is the first time I purchased a piece of electronics that is sold without a power supply. This is like buying a new car without an engine or wheels. Or a key, just to be forced to buy the key separately for 20% of the price of the car. Absolutely terrible.

When I touch the left margin (anywhere) it goes back not one but several pages. It may be 2 or 3 pages or an entire chapter. Going forward is not as problematic but sometimes it skips a page, rarely more than a page or two.
Usually the problem occurs when I’ve been reading a long time but not always.
I called customer support. Because the Kindle was not producing errors on demand, the guy I spoke with refused to help. His only advice: call Amazon in the middle of the night when I could prove the problem existed. I reminded him the Kindle malfunction was not on demand and it happened often while reading but not on repeat. He could have cared less.

I had it by my side all the time, used it for years without issue (though I will admit it did lag occasionally). But this new one, despite its glowing features that led me to buy it, including the warm light and waterproof/water resistant nature (not that this second feature matters -- because my old Kindle Paperwhite and my standard Kindle handle splashes just fine), was an utter disappointment. I bought it mainly for the warm light feature so that reading before bed doesn't disrupt sleep quite as much, but given that I have bought it for such a feature, it had limited use (staying in the bedroom and only used for times when I read immediately before bed). Well, I bought it in October, only finished a grand-total of one full novel on it and only used it for roughly a hand-full of times, and it already has an issue. Stuck on the boot screen, unable to fully boot in or turn off (holding the power button for however long (40 seconds, 5 minutes, 1 hour, etc.) doesn't work, neither does charging). The customer service is okay... if you get the right person... but to be honest, at this point, I feel that the replacement device isn't worth my time. I am not looking forward to dealing with the problem a second time and I can read hours before sleep instead with much more reliable Kindles.

1560,"Quick summary: This Kindle provides a lovely reading experience, but has software issues; I'm on my second replacement.

I’ve been reading on Kindles since 2009. The 6.8"" version of the Kindle Paperwhite is my 4th Kindle, so I typically have Kindles them for about 2-3 years before getting sucked in by a shiny new model. Usually, my old Kindle is still functioning fine at that point, and I hand it down to one of my kids.

The 6.8” Kindle paperwhite has been a stark departure from the reliability I’m used to. I received one as a Christmas gift in 2021, and was initially very happy. I love the design updates, the wider screen, and the warmth screen features. I wasn’t crazy about the size (a little too big to hold comfortably), but that problem is easily solved with a case or a pop socket.

After about two months of reading, my book froze. I went to the home screen to discover my library had disappeared (still in Amazon, just gone from the Kindle). I attempted to reboot, and the Kindle got stuck in an endless reboot cycle. It would load up to the screen with the tree, freeze (it never showed the progress bar), shut itself off, and try to restart again… until the battery ran out.

I called Amazon customer service in late February and had outstanding help. I returned my broken Kindle, received a replacement, and was once again happily reading. The replacement worked for about 1.5 months until one night my book froze and… I had another endlessly rebooting Kindle. The exact same problem.

I contacted customer service again in May and asked to return the Kindle, planning to buy an older model with the refund. I was told I was out of the 30 day return window, and all they could offer was a replacement.

I appreciate the second replacement, which is on its way, but now every time I’m reading I’ll be wondering if this is the day my book freezes and I'm on the phone with customer service again...",1.0
1561,"I've been a kindle reader for years. I recently had to replace my 10th generation paperwhite, and saw this new 12th gen. It has a built in anti glare screen, and uses a Type C android charger.

I'll give it a few days to see how I adjust, but might be returning it too.",1.0
1562,"I purchased this as a black Friday gift. The moment I booted this device up and tried to register it to an Amazon account, I kept getting an error that said ""username and password does not match an Amazon account. Please try again"" I then tried connecting it through the app on my phone and I received the same error message on the kindle, after my phone said that it was successfully registered. I then deregistered my devices under Amazon and did a hard reset on the device--same issue. I realized that the kindle was automatically registered under my Amazon account. I tried to deregister from my account so I could ensure the kindle would be registered. However, all attempts to sign into any Amazon account were unsuccessful. I reached out to Amazon's customer service who could and would not do anything else to assist me but issue a refund. Aside from this experience, the kindle was so slow and glitchy, definitely not worth purchasing it. I'm almost happy things turned out this way, because the hardware on the kindle device seemed to be very outdated. There was a delay with every tap. There are no back buttons during the registration process which leads you to have to restart the entire device each time you attempt to register it. And, also, it wouldn't charge past 99% battery.

My other kindle worked fine and I was pleased. Last night I was shocked to find that Amazon just wiped my old Kindle clean!!!! Oh no!! 40+ books with notes reviews highlights etc!! So, if you only buy books from Amazon and like adds and like a monthly subscription (Five Stars). If you like downloading out of print books, making notes and highlighting, reviewing then beware. You will likely lose them all when your Kindle stops working or deletes them all. (Minus Five Stars). I'm returning this Kindle (as I got it to keep from losing the books I had on my old Kindle.)

1584,"Feels like I'm reading through a foggy haze. The text is not crisp, the brightest color is too ""warm,"" and for indoors reading the Paperwhite is greatly inferior to a tablet or, for that matter, a smart phone. Reading outdoors on a bright day, however, it truly has no equal.

The design engineers must have failed to try it out before production, because if one tries to hold the Paperwhite with one hand, while reading, you soon discover you frequently touch the power button and turn off your reader. The button should have been located on the top or upper side of the device.

When holding the device with one hand, and advancing the pages using a thumb swipe, the book will skip backwards three pages. Whereas this doesn't happen too frequently, it does happen often enough to be extremely annoying.

The two outstanding features of the Paperwhite are its long battery life and bright light functionality. It flat blows away the other e-reader devices in those two areas.

Bottom line - I wouldn't recommend buying the Kindle Paperwhite unless you do a lot of reading outside in bright sunlight and/or read for hours at a time and don't want to keep your tablet/smart phone plugged in to the charger.",5.0

So, if I want to advance to the next page, I touch the right side of the screen. The problem is that very often it advances several pages so that I lose my place and I have to backtrack to find the page it should have just turned to.

I currently use a 2014 paper white and wanted to get this new 2021 upgraded unit. However, I find this new unit has a very soft almost fuzzy screen. The contrast, between the black letters and book covers and the bright white background is low, soft and bland. The letters should POP! But they don’t!

E-ink technology is getting worse, the letters on my older model are so sharp, crisp and clear and look like they’re almost floating on the background. On this new model they more or less just blend in with the fuzzy background. I’ve read that is because they made the screen flush on this model and that involves adding more layers of plastic which dull the contrast.

It’s a real shame that people new to E-readers think that this is a such great device. Don’t get me wrong it has some great attributes, but at the end of the day, it’s all about the display quality and when you have something to compare it with, this new model doesn’t deliver.

2. The location of the power button at the bottom of the device is not a good location to be, because it gets turned off in the middle of a reading.

In all the new device is nice, display and background light warmth is improved, but it may be trying to be too smart and do too much, which leads to usability glitches that make me rate it only 3 stars.",3.0

1633,"This Kindle drives me crazy. It freezes so I can't turn pages at least once or twice a day (I read maybe 3 hours a day) and has to be rebooted in order to function again, which takes maybe 5 minutes each time.. Sometimes when I go to the top to get a menu, it does not work, or the menu comes up but menu items such as table of contents will not come up or only come up after being touched 5 or 6 times and after a delay of a minute or so. Frequently after I close down and come back later the display will be not where I left off but a couple of chapters or more behind where I left off and I have to hunt for my current location (not easy when I can't get the table of contents to display either).

I only bought this Kindle because my old paperwhite would no longer hold a charge, but I sadly miss my old reader. It had none of these problems and gave me many happy, trouble-free hours of reading. This new one is so SO much inferior in almost every way. This current one is called 11th generation Paperwhite, Firmware Version 5.14.1.1. I do not recommend it!",3.0

1642,"*EDITED* to add that as of yesterday, the Kindle no longer functions. It seems to have tried to install an update, and is now stuck on the “Kindle” Home Screen with the logo, and every attempt to hard restart the device only results in a cycling of the Home Screen. I’m not able to unlock it or do anything else with it. Thankfully, Amazon warranty has promised to send me a new device, so here’s to hoping that the Kindle I received was simply bugged out and the replacement works as promised.

This gist: the Kindle Paperwhite has done everything I would expect a ""basic"" Kindle to do, but isn't worth the extra money.

Pros: I can read e-books, which saves me money and space in my apartment.

Cons:
- the pages turn in flickers/flashes, and only sometimes land me on the next or previous page
- the transition from light to dark mode is discombobulating, with another series of flickers or flashes and sometimes freezing on the drop down menu
- I have yet to experience the battery life lasting past a week, let alone the promised 10 weeks
- recently, when I try to resume reading, the Kindle drops me to a random spot in the book rather than resuming where I left off

Not impressed, and I will be seeking to replace the Kindle with the basic version to save myself money and expectations.",3.0
1643,"For those of us with poor vision, the ability to increase the font size makes the Kindle indispensable.

- rest the device against a table

- change your grip by supporting the bottom of the device
- etc.

This is such an elementary issue, I can only imagine how embarrassed the Paperwhite product manager must be for not user testing the device enough in real life contexts.

Other than this obvious oversight it's a great device. The screen is beautiful. However, I'm returning mine due to the design problem.

Not having a page turn button is extremely inconvenient. Have to swipe for every page turn. Barely holds a charge. Sorry to report this. I have had almost every version since the very first one.

1734,"I ave had Kindles for years (maybe 5 o 6, over 10 or more years)-- all the basic model. I decided to upgrade to a Paperwhite this time. Disaster! My Library (Lengthy!) did not appear on the new machine. Instead, an icon appeared indicating 46 international dictionaries contained on the Kindle -- no books, just 46 dctionaries--which of course I had not ordered. I called and called for help over weeks. Everyone was kind and had different ideas of the nature of the problem and what the solution could be, but nothing worked. Exhausted I just gave up. What should I do now?",2.0
1735,"THIS IS A 2-FOLD REVIEW!!
The Paperwhite I bought, $139.00, then insurance was NOT GOOD. Just like the customer service I got on it. Paperwhite was nice and light, when it worked it worked but not great, but ok! I made 4 different phone calls to tell them my paperwhite I ordered on Nov. 28th and got a couple days later had quit working!! It worked 3 quarters of the way for 3 months! The Insurance phone number got me nothing, but line drop after about 5 min of talking to them.

The Amazon Customer service sucks. 1st call, gentleman was so nice, no problem, would send me a new one in two days and instructions to return one not working. Then an email, a delay in shipping and I would be notified of new shipping date! NOTHING, waited, called 2nd time, got a gentleman that was nasty!! Could or would not give me a new shipping date said I would get an e-mail with that on it!! Never came, only another one e-mail telling me I would get another e-mail!!!! Third call to Insurance, got a nice lady was trying to help me after 15 min we got cut off, not call back! Called a 4th time, Amazon, talked to gentleman that was very nice, I was not, I ask to speak to supervisor, never got to. This guy had me place a new order, (CHARGED TO MY ACCOUNT) told me they would refund it when I sent back the one not working!!!! Will see! Will back and by a Kindle or another reader somewhere else, NOT AMAZON!! THIS PLACE HAS GOTTEN TO BIG FOR IT'S SELF.",2.0
1736,"Update: buying the 2018 version, easier to hold like a book, less glitchy.

First off the Paperwhite from 2015 or so worked perfectly. It had a wider border, and the screen functioned well. Read at least 200 hours using it without complaint. This newer Paperwhite’s edges are too thin for how sensitive the touchscreen engages. There’s not much room to hold without touching the screen. I’ll tap the far left on accident and it’ll turn; but it’ll also turn the wrong direction often. I’ll tap the reverse direction and be two or 3 pages off before realizing it glitched. The older model worked far better.",2.0

I traded in a mint condition kindle for only 20$. My trade in came back to me as ""not the correct item"" after speaking to 6 different people I was made to understand that it was because I shipped it with a cover and I had not purchased it with a cover. So I arranged for another trade in. When they returned the kindle to me they did so with an adapter and cord, that were not mine. I included a note stating that fact. I just checked my account and they dropped the value from 20$ to 15$/working. Like I said above you can actually resell mine as new. No scratches no issues it was in mint condition.

The Kindle would freeze and stop working entirely. This first happened four days after I got the new release. Amazon Support was great and sent a new one. After 30 days, the second one had the same issue. The screen would stop on the loading screen and nothing more would happen. I went through all the steps Amazon Support recommends, and still nothing. The Kindle is essentially dead when stuck on the loading screen.

The ordeal to get a replacement for the a second one was a month-long nightmare. I spoke with Support multiple times regarding my replacement. I had already sent in the original, malfunctioning drvice after being told I wouldn't get a replacement until I sent it in.

Every representative I talked to said the new one would ship, that it was in the advanced stages of shipping and couldn't be cancelled. Finally, after speaking with 10 different reps, over the course of two weeks, I got a refund. I don't know if I'll get a new Kindle Paperwhite or just let it go.",5.0

So now if I don’t send the old kindle back they will charge me for the replacement….. that they still have. So I’m afraid to even open and use the replacement because they are going to charge me another kindle. This is just inexcusable incompetence. Maybe if I post this as a review it has a chance of reaching someone who can fix this. You can use the UPS tracking # to verify that the original kindle is still in your possession.",5.0

However, while its screen is more responsive and broader, it used to freeze every time I tried to browse in the Kindle store or download new books.

Battery life is also very short, it doesn't last for weeks or a month as promised. In fact, it has a shorter lifespan than my old Kindle's battery had when it was new.

Update - Amazon reimbursed me the money, as support center couldn't help with kindle. So, I bought the new one.

And the only way to get decent contrast with the normal/light mode was to turn the brightness up to a setting that is uncomfortable for my eyes.

I had to fight for hours with Amazon support to get a refund under the "" 1 year warranty"" and even then it wasn't a full refund.

It will not download any kindle books I had bought for previous kindle (that one quit working less than a year old). This new one won't even work upon it's delivery to me from Amazon!
I also tried charging it's battery. It did not charge at all. Used their charging cable and after leaving it for over 7-10 hours, no charge.

I purchased this because I may be going blind, and planned to use it to listen to books, if I do lose my sight. But also to read books for as long as I can. I am disabled (can't walk, on oxygen all the time, etc) and almost don't get out of my house due to my bad health. I was so counting on being able to use the kindle to read books and especially to read Bible.

UPDATE: Well, an Amazon rep. called me shortly after the review was placed and talked me through doing a sort of 'reset' and got the kindle up and working. I was so happy.

However, it just stopped working. I got it in February and it is now may. It just acts like it’ll load but it never comes off the loading screen.

I've gone around in a circle with customer support for a half hour now trying to get it sorted out but its becoming quite clear they don't care about honoring the standard retail arrangement of exchanging defective items.

I received the Paperwhite and immediately started learning how it worked. I have lots of cons which is why I returned the Paperwhite and went back to my Kindle Fire.

Display: Kindle Fire has a color display, Paperwhite does not. I thought I’d be okay with this and I wasn’t. I like seeing book covers and text in color. Although the Paperwhite does have a lot more options for font size and style, screen brightness.

Interface: Kindle Fire has all of your buttons for home, back, text, notes at the bottom of the screen. I like this setup. Paperwhite you had to tap the screen and have all of the buttons pop up. Some were at the top, some at the bottom. A lot of times when I would tap the screen the page would turn. It was very frustrating and probably the biggest dislike I had with the Paperwhite. Home Screen on the Paperwhite is also very confusing and not user friendly.

Battery: Depending on how much I use my Kindle Fire the battery usually lasts about 12 reading hours. I used the Paperwhite for 24 hour reading hours and the battery hardly went down at all.

Processing: I thought the Paperwhite would be fast in its processing speed but it wasn’t any faster than my Kindle Fire.

While we were out of the house, the replacement's digitizer shattered while sitting at room temperature (~67 F) on a table. Said Kindle also had a screen protector on. Unsure if this was due to shoddy quality of electronics or some other mysterious circumstances.

Also of note, her previous Kindle died while sitting on the counter while she was taking a shower, presumably due to the moisture in the air.

I purchased insurance from Amazon, and as such they're currently shipping me a new Kindle Paperwhite as a replacement for her replacement.

In sum, if buying a Paperwhite, ensure you get insurance as well.",3.0

Especially once the warranty ends, because they will just give you a 15% off coupon for a new kindle. This seems like a known issue with Amazon! Definitely worried for after the warranty, but I honestly had the best time reading for the 4 days it was working fine.

No amount of charging or button pressing is saving this kindle.
People even suggested throwing it in a freezer. I did it out of desperation and a last resort, but still nothing.

----- original review ----

I bought what was probably a very early Kindle Paperwhite, in 2011. It lasted this long mostly because all I want from an ereader is to read ebooks. But it was starting to act up.
This upgrade was easy to install. I'm used to technology, am not sure it would be as easy for a novice. Help files on the device only help after you install the device!
No screen freezes so far, everything works fine.
The interface is ok, no complaints though it isn't a big improvement from the old one. Only gripe for me is the annoying ""highlighters"" message above some passages.
Overall I am ok with this new kindle.",2.0

You no longer have the option of defaulting to the Library screen, and it always goes to the Home screen, which is just trying to recommend you more books.

On the library screen, the list view is comically huge to the point where you can only see 5 books/files per page. They don't want you to browse your own books/files. You can't change the size, it's so irritating.

The brightness setting is pointless. Regardless of where you set it, it will default to max brightness when you open it up for the first time, before reducing to your requested brightness a few seconds later. This is a huge annoyance as I read at night.
The reworked UI doesn't add any features while making you click 2-3 more times to adjust common settings like 'Brightness' or 'Font size'.

2013,"I bought the new version of the Paperwhite in November. I have owned three different kindle versions (my husband and kids also have Fires) and I have used one for many years every single day. I was excited about finally seeing that there was an updated version. There are some things that I liked about the updated device, like the quicker turning pages, but I didn't notice much of a difference between the older size and the newer, larger size. I was not a fan of the new library set up, but overall, it was a fine device. However, after less than 6 months, it went into a cycle where you couldn't turn it on-it would boot up like it was turning on, but then would turn immediately back off. It does this every 40 seconds...and has for the past few days. It charges, but is stuck in an initialization cycle. I spent 20 minutes on a chat with Amazon help today and they will refund my money (after I send it back), but now I don't know whether to order another one or not.

So, if you love reading The New York Times and Washington Post daily on your Kindle Paperwhite, you will be driven mad. Hours of time wasted with tech support trying in vain to fix this, only to be informed, finally, that there is no fix and the automatic daily download of my newspapers is a problem Amazon is working on. So, I have to completely reset my Kindle every single day if I want to read today’s newspaper. This involves inputting my Internet password, Amazon password, choosing my language and country, waiting for the device to reset, declining Kindle Unlimited, and many more steps. Supremely irritating if you want to read the newspaper with your morning coffee. And this problem has been going on for months. This is an example of how Amazon’s software “upgrades” have ruined a great feature of the Kindle Paperwhite.

I never thought that I'd lose all my books and collections with an upgrade but books do not transfer and collections have to be recreated...after you download the book again!

On my second device, it was a yellow blotch appearing slightly above the bottom left corner, with a diameter about 1/5 of screen width. Again, my eyes are attracted to it every time I read to that location.

Both issues would appear under low ambient light, and disappear if ambient/day light is strong, so it seems that it's a front light issue. If I turn warm light all the way to max, I won't notice them, but the screen would be just too yellow.

2186,Last update 5.14.2 royaly destroyed this reader everything is in grid view there is now no choice for list view on anything. If you had collections set up on any kindle devices they show up on this device. Collections you have on any Amazon device shows up. You used to be able to pick what collection you wanted to see on this device not all of them. And still all are in grid view. And they have added a new collection called unclaimed. Its everything had in your cloud. You cannot remove any collection from this device without permanently removing the collection from all your devices. And forget about finding your book you just downloaded it can't be found without searching for it. It no longer appears just below your collections. And on a final note this thing keeps locking up on a daily basis and has to be restarted every time after this crappy update ruined my kindle.,2.0

Right away I disliked the protruding power button on the bottom that was super sensitive and would power off/on when propping the Kindle up to read or if packed in my handbag. Within a month it was glitchy. I knew getting a new one would be a nightmare--plus I am always in the middle of a good book!--so I just would reboot it. So many times I lost my place.

Please make an updated version in the old size. I had my first kindle for five years. I have had to buy a new one every 1.5-2 years for the past three. Amazon only seems to be good at taking things that were fine and changing them for the worse.

The only real advantage to using this over a phone or tablet, is it is a little lighter than my tablet. Considering my tablet is a Samsung S7, big deal.

This type of kindle died 2 times on me, the first and replacement both froze on the tree screen after a few weeks.

2351,"I purchased the 16GB Agave Green Paperwhite 11th gen, and I read exclusively Kindle format ebooks (no audiobooks.) I was an avid Kindle app user but when I started to borrow ebooks from my public libraries with the Libby app, my reading skyrocketed. Up until that point, I was using an iPad mini but the screen was ill-suited for that much reading and the battery life drains quickly since it's still a full-functioning tablet. The Kindle Paperwhite 11th gen is my first Kindle and e-reader device, and my thoughts are below:

Pros:
- Lightweight, significantly more so than my iPad mini 5th gen
- Screen creates less strain for my eyes, and it's much more comfortable to read for long periods of time
- Setup and transfer of my Kindle app library were a breeze
- The matte screen is great at preventing glare (but you'll still get fingerprints)
- I'm happy to report that I barely notice the ads. The ads are for recommended books and Kindle-related things anyway, so no big deal. I was just concerned about getting ads related to my random Amazon shopping, which is not the case.
- Agave Green is a beautiful neutral green, not too obnoxious but note that the color of the device is visible from the front of the device as a thin colored border going around the screen

Cons:
- No continuous scroll capability, which is available only in Kindle app apparently
- Screen refresh inverts image color for a flash second. For example, when you toggle in and out of the settings, the screen flashes an inverted image to ""refresh"" itself to the new page. A little annoying since it feels low-tech and less seamless than the Kindle app I had transitioned from using.
- Battery life won't last a full 10 weeks. The battery life is advertised as ""up to 10 weeks,"" but if you read a LOT and use bright display settings, it will drain within 1-2 weeks.
- When your tablet is asleep, it still displays an ad, which I'm sure drains some of the battery life. I'm hoping to remedy this with a case with the magnetic auto sleep/wake cover feature, but we'll see
- Adding another user and their corresponding library took some finagling, but even when it's set up, it's not UX-friendly because you can't toggle between the two users' libraries. You can only see either 1) your collective libraries together in one giant library, OR 2) you can select a filter at the top of the collective library to only see your or the other user's books.
- When I carry the Kindle device case-less and loose in my backpack or tote bags, it accidentally unlocks all the time. I don't have a passcode so if the button next to the charging port is pressed to ""wake"" the Kindle and something in my bag brushes against the screen to ""swipe"" and unlock the Kindle, it's open the screen is active. I've accidentally drained battery life this way too. The recommendation here is to get a case, cover, or sleeve for your Kindle.

2642,"I love my new Kindle Paperwhite!

Not long ago, I left my Kindle at home on a business trip. I struggled with the decision to upgrade and send the Paperwhite to my hotel, or to have my existing standard Kindle overnighted to me. Ultimately I had my existing Kindle shipped.

I have come to regret that decision. I upgraded not long after that and the experience of the Paperwhite is well worth the extra cost. If you're stuck in a similarly priced conundrum: if you are deciding between the cheaper standard Kindle (or the cost to overnight one!) and the Paperwhite, the cost difference is marginal while the upgrades are palpable.

There are many reviews of the Kindle Paperwhite from a new Kindle owner perspective. This review focuses on those who are considering upgrading from a standard Kindle to the Paperwhite and for those who are trying to choose between the two devices.

It's easy to rationalize each and every feature of the Paperwhite as unnecessary. Technically, that is true. There is nothing the Paperwhite does compared to the standard Kindle that can be considered essential.

But let's face it: Kindle's in general are not essential... they're just really nice to have.

You might be wondering, for example, why you would want to read for an hour under 2 meters of water, save for preventing some accidental damage if you're reading in the bath. This, however, is an important and understated design feature. Though the IPX8 rating doesn't test for solid ingress, it would be hard to design a device to prevent liquid ingress and not prevent access of dust and debris.

It is a strange decision to not test for a solid ingress rating, such as IP68. Amazon is burying the lead on this... the Kindle Paper White doesn't allow solid objects to get caught in the bezel. My former, standard, Kindle does. When a small particle of dust or pet hair gets caught in the bezel of my former Kindle, the screen does not register page swipes reliably. The bezel area in that Kindle is very thin and difficult to clean, which makes this issue difficult to resolve.

The Kindle Paper White has no access to the bezel, the entire front is uniform. This is a major improvement in design and, in and of itself, represents a worthy reason to upgrade. This is the primary reason I wanted to move up to the Paper White. You can see in the photos the gap between the standard Kindle's bezel and screen that causes me some issues. If you plan on reading in the hot tub, there’s no comparison to be made between these two Kindles. I haven’t done so, but I imagine dropping the standard Kindle in the pool would result in far worse, irreversible damage than some dust on the screen, while the Paperwhite would suffer no damage at all.

The other benefits to the Paper White were surprisingly nice, especially given that I hadn't initially considered them to be poignant at all. My favorite unexpectedly useful feature is the automatically adjustable variable light temperature setting. While it is nice to be able to make the Kindle's light warmer or cooler, it is much more practical to have this transition happen on a schedule. This way you can have a bright white light during the day, and have the backlight automatically turn to a soft warm light when reading at night. This prevents eye strain if you read to sleep and it an excellent feature.

Other features that have improved on the Paperwhite:

The fonts on the Paperwhite are smoother. The larger screen allows for more words on a page or a larger font size, allowing for a more pleasant experience. The page turns occur about twice as quickly on my new Paperwhite vs my former Kindle. The UI elements, for example accessing the menus or the Kindle store, are much more responsive on the Paperwhite.

It would be harder to justify the price increase of the Oasis, as there don't seem to be any compelling advantages to that model over this one. The Paperwhite strikes an excellent value of features compared to pricing. Just be careful to get the most recent version, as some of the bundles contain older versions of this device.",5.0
2643,"This review is for anyone who is debating between the new kindle Paperwhite and the Libra 2.

If you are like me, you do extensive online research, obsess over reddit forums, YouTube reviews, etc... before making a decision on any electronic device that you buy. I probably watched every single YouTube review of Libra 2 and Paperwhite, and most reviewers said that both were basically equivalent.

Well, I went ahead and bought both to try them, and here is what I liked/didnt like between the two:

Observations:
* Paperwhite is significantly lighter weight than the Libra 2. Although it is lighter, it is a lot harder/straining to hold than the Libra 2. Because the size bezels are thin, it is really un-ergonomic hold with your thumb right on the edge. Or you can hold it from the bottom, but that becomes awkward after about 30-45mins too. The Libra 2 however, is heavier, but has a, IMO, much more ergonomic grip and has space to put your thumb. This allows your other fingers to grip the device from the back much easier.

* The way Libra 2 formats the text on the screen is better than Paperwhite. It also allows for a few more customizations which, for me, make huge differences. Libra 2 allows you to put the position of where you are in the chapter and the chapter name at the top of the screen. It also allows you to display your position in the entire book at the bottom of the device. For kindle, it just has a couple options of showing how much time you have left in the chapter, and how much time of reading is left in the book at the very bottom left. You don't know how many times I accidentally tap on the screen and lose where am in the book. With kindle, I have no idea what page I am on when I accidentally tap on the page. On the Libra 2, I see the page numbers and its super easy to re-orient myself.

* Everyone says the screen quality between the kindle and libra are equivalent. I one million percent disagree. Libra 2 display is WAY more crisp and clear. The dark mode on Libra 2 is leagues better than paperwhite. When you look at them side by side, it is obvious that the Libra 2 screen is better. My wife also looked at both and instantly noticed how much better the Libra 2 screen is. It is seriously unbelievable how crisp it is.

* The whole ADS on the Kindle leaves such a sour taste in my mouth. I hate the fact that the Kindle shows ads and you have to pay to remove them. And even when you remove them, their homepage still has all the kindle store recommendations shoved up your face. Libra's interface is so much lighter. It just displays your books and that's basically it. I like that.

* People say that both devices are equally responsive. I disagree. There isn't a HUGE difference, but there is a noticeable difference in Libra 2 being faster than Kindle. When I want to go back into the Home Screen (exit out of a book) the Libra 2 does it within 1 second. Kindle takes 2+ seconds to go back to the home page. I also notice Kindle does a lot more flashing and redrawing than Libra. I don't know if I can scientifically prove that though, its just my observation, so take that with a grain of salt.

* Libra 2 has reading statistics for you. Its a really minor thing, but I really like it. I like to see how long I've read, how fast I read, etc, and Libra has a nice interface to see that. It is kind of like the Apple Watch fitness tracking, where you can go into the app and see all the workouts you have done. Its not required, but its nice to see your progress and makes you motivated to keep going.

* I really like the Kindle's dictionary and flashcards feature. Anytime you look up a word on Kindle, it automatically saves it and you can go to all the words you've looked up and run them in a flashcards word define game. On the Libra, you can also save words for the dictionary, but there is no flashcard game.

* I haven't really used the Kobo app, but the kindle app I think is really amazing. The syncing between the Kindle app and the kindle device is great. I don't know if the kobo device have that, but I think Kindle just wins on this front. I don't read on my phone, so its not a huge deal for me.

* Kindle uses a proprietary format it uses for the books. Libra does not-- it just uses the `epub` format.

You can use what you find most important and purchase that. Both devices are really good at what they do, but I personally find the Libra 2 a much more bang for your buck, and an overall better device for me.

I hope you find this useful!",5.0

2667,"I am so deeply disappointed by this. It's at least my 5th or 6th Kindle, and I've loved them all, but I'm shocked at this awful product. Even the very first Kindle ever made was better than this one.

First, the touch screen is barely responsive. It's slower and more difficult to work than the original Kindle. This is really frustrating. I remember playing games on my first Kindle. You can barely swipe from one page to another on this one, and forget trying to scroll through your library.

It's barely readable. Dark mode or light doesn't matter, the whole thing is a grayish color and is just very difficult to read no matter how big the words or bright the screen. The worst is trying to scroll through the library to find a book. Aside from the scrolling issue and horrible controls, the covers of the books are barely discernible, like a really bad display from the days of early computers. Only worse.

Worst of all, it doesn't do Audible samples. This is the reason I purchased it in the first place. I send the samples to myself, then I can listen to them before choosing an Audio book. This will play audio with a bluetooth speaker, but it does not support Audible samples, so you would need to buy the book first. In fact, I notice most of the Audible sample options are gone from books, and the only way to listen to a sample now is to go to the website and listen to it there. And forget going on the website and buying and anything or listening to a sample - the display of the website is so bad that I couldn't read anything on it. The words were nearly microscopic and it was impossible to navigate the website at all. Add in the fact that zooming in or scrolling is next to impossible with the poor controls and touch screen, and it's just not even a realistic thing to do.

The only thing that makes this workable is the addition of a scroll bar. With the scroll bar, I can use the bar to move through the MANY pages of books, rather than page through them one page at a time. Even so, using the scroll bar is difficult in LARGER collections with more than 100 books.

This is like Windows vs. DOS.
Yeah windows is easier to learn and looks friendly, but DOS was more efficient and faster.

We need an option to select a higher book per screen list mode display.

Secondly, the PW performance can be sluggish, to the point that the PW sometimes seems to have hung, and the only way to do anything is to do a hard restart of the PW.
What solved this problem was to turn Airplane mode ON, thus turning WiFi OFF. With WiFi OFF the PW performance is reasonable.
So, it appears that the PW is ""calling home to Amazon a LOT,"" and using up a lot of the processing power of the PW, leaving little left for you.",1.0
2675,"I loved my Kindle. Until just recently they decided to do a software update that complete changed the way you interface with the Kindle. Now, instead of my books on pages, which were easy to navigate, there's an endless scroll feature, that JUST. KEEPS. GOING. and constantly means you're lost at sea when trying to scroll through your list of books. The scroll menu is HORRIFYINGLY bad. I hate the icon being attached to the ""list"" feature. Before you used to have ""gallery"" view with all the book fronts in a picture icon, or just a list of the titles. Now you can't have just a list of the titles absent these stupid pictures cluttering up the list. The pull down menu is a tragedy. Every single new feature on this software update is BAD. Literally, there is not a single thing that I think was improved by this new software update.

I share an account with my mom because she's not all that tech savvy and that way I can just buy her books and send them to her Kindle. Except now we're stuck trying to wade through each other's books on the Home screen. It's awful, and about 10x harder to find things.

As for the hardware and design...it's okay. The power button is not in a great location and I do accidentally turn the Kindle off when I don't want to. Battery life is also not all that great if you're using the light. I had to make sure I had a full charge every morning while I was on vacation because I was running out of juice at the beach. If you only read a couple of hours a day it's probably fine. The unit it also smaller than it really needs to be.

Now imagine the only way you can scroll through them is by viewing their document icons in a grid pattern, rather than just being able to read the file names from top to bottom. Well, that's what you'll have to do if you buy the latest Kindle Paperwhite.

If you've bothered to create Collections to organize your books, forget them. They'll still be there, but you won't be able to view them in List format. Instead, you'll be forced into a glacially slow scroll through grids of book covers from left-to-right, top-to-bottom, squinting to read the book titles amidst all the useless graphic nonsense. It used to be that you could opt out of this obnoxious view and manually switch back to List view, but for some reason, Amazon has taken that option away. What an amazingly bad decision in an age where Accessibility is a by-word.

I can't fathom why they did this. Do they think they're somehow going to turn my black-and-white Kindle into some kind of dazzling display of artistic wonder? Do they think they're going to sell me more books by enticing me with pictures of books that I already own?

Whatever. Amazon appears to have embraced the ""we know better than you, and your preferences are meaningless"" attitude that is endemic in today's tech world. If I were you, I wouldn't buy a Kindle until they've stopped trying to control your navigation preferences. I mean, look at your bookshelves at home. You have a system, right? Whatever that system is, you know right where to go to find what you're in the mood to read, and all you have to do is go to that section and peruse the titles on the spines. If someone came along and messed with your system...if they told you could no longer organize by genre and that you must place your books so the full cover displays instead of just the spines...what would you tell them? I'm guessing it would involve at least one curse word.

2716,"The most recent update makes searching for previously purchased, downloaded content take much, much longer than it used to. This is extremely frustrating to longtime Kindle users. This is due to several changes:

1. Because of the pictures of the books, only 4 items can be displayed on the screen in a list at one time. So one has to get through more screens to even read through a list. It would be GREAT if there could be an option in ""Library View"" to not show the cover picture icons.

2. Previously, in ""Library View"" collections were (or could be) listed together at the top of a list, with un-collected items below ordered based on recent usage. After the update, items are listed (again, just 4 at a time) as collections and both collected (in a collection) and uncollected items in, for example, ""recently used"" order. The very frustrating thing is that both the item and the collection that item is in are listed as separate items on the screen. This means that if the two most recent items read were from 2 different collections, from the main ""Library"" screen, one sees just those items and the collections they belong to, because the display now only holds 4 items at at time.

3. There is a scrolling arrow button on the side of the screen to help with scrolling, which is a much more frequent task now that one can only see 4 items in a list at a time. When going back to ""Library"" after reading something, the list is not reordered until one goes back to the top (keep tapping that arrow) of the list. It would be better, for the ""Library"" function, to get rid of the pictures and this arrow - allowing only 2 lines for information about any item. Being able to view 8 items at a time (instead of just 4) would cut the need for scrolling in half.

It seems that the update was created by a person or people who have not used Kindles very much. The redesigned interface seems more appropriate for larger, brightly backlit, shiny color screens like iPads, not for much-easier-on-the-eyes-for-serious-readers e-readers. The re-designation of ""Home"" in the previous update as a marketing tool was not overly bothersome since what was previously ""Home"" got the new label of ""Library"" and worked basically the same way the former ""Home"" used to. However, the most recent update has made even the ""Library"" view awkward and slow to use.

Many long-time Kindle users have extensive libraries and keep hundreds of items on their Kindle e-readers all the time. This was the case even before the major memory upgrades that allow e-book fans to easily carry even MORE titles around with them. It is hoped that a new update will come out soon either restoring the previous ""Library"" view or at least allowing for simpler searching of large libraries.

I love my Kindle, and I hope that the very serious problems with the most recent update will be fixed soon. I would be delighted to help whatever team is responsible for this improve the Kindle experience.",1.0

This year, the touch screen became very oversensitive to the point where it seems there is a virus on it. Without touching it, it randomly selects words, gets stuck, opens the settings bar and even kicks me out of the book.

I asked customer service for help and other than telling me to restart and reset, they were unable to do anything about it. I was offered the consolation price of a 20% discount on getting myself a new kindle.

So basically, things are done so cheaply now that I am just supposed to throw away a device that should be able to be easily fixed. What is it with this throw away culture?? How is it that the only advice to fix something is to restart? That's what I used to do 20 years ago as a lab assistant in college, there has to be a smarter answer than restart or throw away.",2.0
2725,"I have had to change my time because something overrode what I set up. My Kindles #4 & 5 sow all books not just the ones downloaded to that device and no matter what I try with the ""new"" sorting nothing changes it back.
You cannot search by just collection. My Kindle #5, none of the collections are alphabetical, like they were previously or even as they are on my other devices. Today, I tried sending a free book as an epub, not mobi since that format is changing, and 4 tries later, I had to send as mobi format before it went through. I kept receiving error messages from Amazon that there was a problem with the document I was sending.
I keep finding books I placed in collections listed as ""uncollected"" on my devices 4, 5, & 6, all the newer devices. I find books and docs sent to 2 devices when I sent to 1.
Preorders and new purchases/free books through Amazon, I choose which device to send it, amazon has been sending to my default one instead and I have to go into my account each time and remove from one device and/or send to correct device.
In addition, you can't just ""remove from device"" on the device, noooo, that doesn't work properly or isn't even an option anymore.
Honestly, quit improving because all that's happening is alot of crap showing up on devices that cannot be changed. Sort is a joke-you can't sort by much, only from entire library.
I have multiple devices for a reason and when I pick up and open a device, I want only what I sent to that device to be on that device both visible and accessible.

---
Within the next few months I will be upgrading to my 5th e-reader and my go to option was always the Paperwhite--until now. Late in 2021, Kindle came out with a new user interface. Unlike the previous version, the new design is not intuitive, it is cumbersome, and frankly, nothing more than a blatant marketing ploy to force readers into KU & one-click purchases.

~For all of my previous Paperwhites, I had paid to remove the ads, but now it doesn't seem to make any difference because the home screen is now littered with ""suggested"" books for me to purchase.
~Prior to the newer version, the home page always took you back to the first page of your library with your most recent read at the top. No more.
~Although this was an inconvenience, the real sticking point for me was the removal of the back button. That was by far the best feature of the Paperwhite. Loved it. Gone.

Suddenly, lo and behold, a couple of weeks ago, Kindle uploaded a bug fix.

~In this version it now shows the thumbnail of each book cover in the library list. What a waste of resources! The text is not legible on the covers and the photos are grayscale-pixelated blobs.
~The new layout only allows you to vertically scroll to review your library list. This serves two purposes, I suppose. First, it forces the reader to use both hands to operate the Kindle, because, ergonomically, you can no longer swipe the screen horizontally with your thumb to advance the page. Secondly, because the covers create a larger surface area, when scrolling the reader is constantly opening books by accident. This usually occurs once every one or two pages.

~Finally, the most egregious offense is that the development team, once again, left behind back button. That is a deal breaker. If it would have been re-instituted with the latest update, all would have been forgiven and I would have continued to purchase Paperwhites.

As the saying goes, all good things must come to an end.",2.0

How come, the information is stored in a database? 2) Kindle makes me manually corral book series into a collection and once done are ordered by name order, not book order. A huge time waster. Almost always, but not always Amazon list the book number but often that IS NOT visible when ordering a book and more often it IS NOT visible when you are deciding which book to read next on the Kindle making it necessary to read Amazon online descriptions, open the last read book to see their “read next” message or open individual books to calculate what must be the first or next book in the series. I just spent 4 hours organizing a collection instead of everything that is more enjoyable. Yes, I’m a little resentful and I still haven’t organized everything. 3) All books should automatically show Author, book name, collection name, book number ordered by Author, collection name, book number. 4) Books in collections that have unread books (<99% read in a book) should show on the collection screen “New” to indicate one or more books in the series is unread. If your programmers have TiVo, tell them to emulate it. 4) When purchasing Kindle book, Amazon should provide the option to purchase the entire series followed by the ability to purchase each book listed by book order, not NAME order. 5) Stop lying to me, when I purchase a book or use the synchronize option give me the book. I HATE, HATE being in an airplane and find that some of my books aren’t on the Kindle. I always what my book immediately download and I always want everything synchronized but yet you still fool me. 6) When a new book in a series is released, put an icon on my book list indicating a new book can be purchased. Allow me to navigate to my book series list, see the suggested book’s name and purchase the book by selecting the buy now icon.

I mainly use my Kindle because it feels more like a book to me. but I guess Amazon feels they know what is best so I don't need a way to revert to a older look and feel. not to mention the so called Home screen they have crammed in that looks like my Amazon home page on my PC where they can ""recommend"" books each time I open my Kindle, and even though I have paid to not receive ads.

2741,"All the sudden my Kindle became a different device POOF! The home page is completely different and I CAN'T STAND IT! HATE IT! I want my old home screen back. Whoever decided on this needs to lose their job, Jeff. The home page is essentially an unending ad! I didn't buy a Kindle with ads.

And there are the other problems I thought I could learn to live with, but really hate. First, how come every generation of Kindle does less than the one before? My Gen 2 had lots of games on it that would not transfer to the old Paperwhite. Now the new Paperwhite will not support any of my games at all. Then there is the tricky, inconsistent touch screen. Sometimes I have to touch three times to get a page to turn. But scrolling through the menus is so touchy that I am constantly opening things I don't want to open. And why does it take so much longer to wake up? The battery does not last as long either. And the battery life indicator on mine has malfunctioned to the point the Kindle essentially shut itself down for lack of power when the indicator said I had 54% power left!

It was a big mistake to ""upgrade"" to this new Kindle. The trajectory of Kindles is NOT improving.

UPDATE: After two weeks with the new Home page/operating system I can say I completely and utterly despise it. It is intrusive and annoying and there's no getting rid of it. Again, this ploy to try to push content at me is despicable. The way my current book is displayed aggravates me entirely. I HATE IT!!!

The Biggies:
Whoever took the store icon off the reading toolbar needs to have their head examined. How often do you suppose Kindle users see something that catches their interest and goes into the store to buy it? Now you have to back out to the Library home screen.
Wikipedia - if I want to look something up while I'm reading, the Invalid Certificate window comes up 3 or 4 times before I get to what I want to see. As far as bringing anything else up once I finally do get into Wikipedia - forget it.
Additionally, I can't go thru the pages of my Library and get back to page one by hitting the home icon - I have to click on the page number at the bottom and go thru that whole process. I don't know how many times I have been using the search function while I was reading and mistakenly hit the back arrow icon instead of X (maybe it's the other way around ...) and left the book I was reading instead of going back to my original page.

Only a minor update based on version number change, but I have not had lockup issues since the update. I do not expect to be using my old Paperwhite 2018 again. I think this is a real winner.

I frequently buy discounted books and have since 2009. The 590 books downloaded take 2.64 GB of the total 6.23 GB available. So for most people this 8 GB model (the Operating System must take about 1.7 GB) should have more than enough storage.

------------------------------------------------------

My Kindle Paperwhite 2021 just arrived.

Initial impressions.

1. It is noticeably faster flipping pages than my Paperwhite 2018. I put the old and new Paperwhites side by side in the photo with the old one on the left and the new on the right. I set the font and display formats the same and flipped through a book. Tapping on them simultaneously, the delay changing pages is quite obvious on the old model and almost non-existent on the new. Rapidly tapping the right edge of the 2021 twice flips through 2 pages. Doing the same thing on the 2018 it only flips one page. Responsiveness is rapid and accurate moving forward and backwards. Superior to the 2018.

2. The larger active area is very nice. With a ruler I measure an area increase of about 33%.

3. It charges faster than the old Paperwhite. It arrive with 60% charge and it quickly charged to 90%.

4. It booted up with latest Kindle software: Version 5.14.1 (October 2021). My old Paperwhite 2018 is running version 5.13.7 for comparison.

5. It is nice having the display warmth control in addition to the brightness.

6. I have had 2 lockups where the only way I could unfreeze was to hold the power button down until it rebooted. That is the reason I am giving this 4 stars instead of 5. The problem occurred when playing with settings and might have something to do with setting extremes on the new Warmth slider and Brightness. I suspect it is going into the sleep mode improperly, because the screen lighting dimmed, but the page still displayed yet would not change when tapping left or right. I am guessing Amazon will fix this soon at which point I will raise my rating.

My review headline understates the improvement in the Paperwhite. I own both the 2016 and 2018 models and this is a much more significant set of updates than between the earlier models. For me, the larger active screen and page turning speed are a big deal.

I look forward to using the new Paperwhite and updating this review.",1.0
2804,"I've owned several Kindles for various reasons and have found them lacking in speed and navigation. Also, I love to read in the bath. This Kindle resolves all those issues since it's waterproof and much improved. The extra space makes this much more readable. The pages flip as fast as on my Kindle Fire (which is heavier and unpleasant to hold). The lighting is very nice.
But there are always bugs whenever something new is rolled out. Here are two I've seen here and tried to resolve on my own Kindle Paperwhite 2021.
Software Update grayed out: in my case, this was because my Kindle came with the latest software.
No KindleUnlimited Free 4 Mos: Agreed. I registered my Kindle (actually, according to my account it was registered the day I ordered it). I did not receive a free 4-month Unlimited subscription. An hour of chat with customer support was to say the least frustrating. In the course of that, an email popped up with the free offer - about 18 hours after I registered the device.
My only gripe is turning off those damned notes. I don't want to read other people's highlights. I had to Google that since turning them off is no longer available under Reading Options. (At least it wasn't on mine.)
This is what you do. Open a book. Go to any page. Tap the top. Under the little house (Home) you'll see the font icon: Aa. Tap that on. A menu will pop up that says Themes Font Layout More. Tap on Moore. Scroll down. Right under ""About this Book"" you'll see Popular Highlights. Slide it off. Phew.
Other than that, love this!",1.0
2805,"The device looks beautiful and I love the big screen, but it froze three times today. I was so happy when I received it yesterday, but now I feel very disappointed.

Setup was easy, and how-to resources are easily accessible right inside the device’s settings.

After about 6 weeks I started to notice that the bottom corners have been getting loose, and I don’t like that. It’s like the screen is separating from the back of the device by a small margin and I have to pinch the corners to put them back in place. It worries me that this is happening so soon after buying.

Only way to get back to reading is a full restart with reload (see picture, typically reloading lasts a few minutes). Hope there is a software update soon. Otherwise the kindle feels great in hand and love that there is finally a USB-C charging port.

Only thing holding me back from a 5-star rating is the software glitches. Constantly having to restart after a few setting changes or even sometimes randomly is incredibly disruptive and unfortunate. I want to love it, but not yet!

2808,"(Update, lowered one star)
I’m disappointed that ads can’t be removed from this Paperwhite. I’ve always preferred paying to clean up the interface on my Kindles. It took two days of customer service calls to finally clarify that this device doesn’t qualify for ad removal. That’s disappointing. Otherwise, my original review below stands
(End update)

I’ve had and loved many Kindles since generation 2.
6 inches is a little small nowadays, though, especially with big phones. I use the Kindle app on my iPhone Max a lot, and it’s nice and keeps the Kindle in the drawer most days, but I’m still much more likely to really get lost in a book and not get distracted with a Kindle. And besides the lack of distraction, e-ink screens are still uniquely pleasing to the eye and touch.
I’ve enjoyed my Oasis for a couple years now. I love the bigger screen and the page-turning buttons, but I don’t love that there’s almost no pocket in the world that can hold it.
The new Paperwhite is a great screen size AND it fits in my pockets! I was worried that I wouldn’t like the smaller bezels on it. I like big bezels. The giant bezel on the Oasis is just dreamy to me, but I’m finding that this Paperwhite is very comfortable to hold in multiple ways without accidental screen touches, so I l’m happy they found an excellent balance between device size, screen size, and bezel size.
The page turns are the zippiest I’ve ever experienced on a Kindle.
Being able to balance the two types of lighting is not essential to me, but I like it.
Otherwise, if you know Kindles, I don’t think there’s anything else new and exciting to report. I love it. Thanks, Amazon!",1.0
2809,"I have owned every single kindle model since the first. (OK maybe I have a problem, but there it is.) lately I would switch back and forth between the Oasis and the Paperwhite. I loved the large, brighter screen of the Oasis, but the odd shape bugged me and I only used the buttons about 25% of the time. I loved the size and shape of the Paperwhite but missed the larger screen and the big fat bezel bothered me. Finally this is a kindle that, for me, combines the best features of both. Great size, all the features of the Oasis, thin bezel and clear bright screen. The battery life seems really good (I have been reading - about 2 to 3 hours a day - for a week and I am still at 66%. This is IMO the best Kindle yet and I am more than pleased with it.

Couple of little points… It has not updated to the new UI but I am sure it will sooner or later. Also I was unable to cancel the ads and get cover view (someone else mentioned this) but a call to customer service, who couldn’t figure it out but entered a ticket for it, put it right within 24 hours.

After using it for a few days, one complaint. Yes the power button is STILL on the bottom so when using it propped up or on a stand the device will attempt to power itself off. Very annoying and with all the updates to this device you would think that moving the button to the top would have been a no brainer

Just adding another update: Today is Nov 8th and I started using this on Oct 29th. I have been reading around 2 or 3 hours a day (without turning on airplane mode for about half of that AND including downloading samples and books) and it is STILL at 44%. So the battery life is probably the best I have experienced even including the older paperwhites. I honestly think that we are heading to 2 week battery life here - something I have seen Amazon claim and have never experienced.

Despite the power button placement, I can't find anything to complain about and highly recommend.",1.0
2810,"Updated my review to 5 stars. I thought the size was going to bother me, but now I can’t imagine using the smaller screen! Also not sure why more people aren’t talking about the page turn animations! I love them!! I sold my previous generation, and now only use the 2021 model.

Previous review: I upgraded from a 10th gen paperwhite. While I LOVE all the new features + USB-C charging, I wish they had just left the overall size of the Kindle the same. Instead they should have just made the bezels thinner on the sides and top of the original size. I didn’t think I’d notice the small size increase, but it definitely makes it harder to hold even with a popsocket. I don’t think I’ll be replacing my 10th gen, but using the 10th gen on the go, and 11th gen at home.

Remember Amazon, if it ain’t broke don’t fix it, aka size of the Kindle!!",5.0
2811,"This new Kindle Paperwhite 2021 is the latest in this line of eReaders, with a few key upgrades over previous versions. As an avid reader of Ebooks, I am always looking for the most comfortable devices to read on, so I was very excited to try out this newest model. Here are my thoughts so far:

Notable upgrades from previous version:
--6.8” Display: previous version was 6”
--USB-C charging: previously was micro-USB. Also now 10 weeks of battery life with 2.5 hour charge
--Faster: quoted as 20% faster page loading
--Brighter: 10% brighter at max brightness, also can adjust “warmth” setting of screen to your preference.

So far, I have enjoyed the larger screen, and this Paperwhite looks nice and bright even on sunny days outside. I obviously appreciate the long-overdue upgrade to USB-C charging, and so far the battery life seems great. I can notice a slight speed difference, I'm not sure if I would've said that it feels like it is 20% faster though. The “warmth” setting bar can shift the color from more of a bluish to a more yellowish tone, on a slider bar. I'll have to test it out more, but so far my eyes seem to prefer reading with the brighter bluish tone.

Overall, the biggest deal for me is having a nice sized screen that is easy to read even in the brightest environments. The waterproof IPX8 rating is nice too, as it makes me feel more comfortable reading outside without worrying about getting it wet. For outdoor reading, nothing really compares to this Kindle Paperwhite and the more expensive Kindle Oasis, as since this is less expensive than the Oasis, it is now my favorite reading device. I look forward to hours of reading outside on this nice bright screen, and I will update this review if I notice any other important details over time.",5.0
2812,"For the money, the newest Kindle Paper White is awesome. I've owned nearly all the Kindles since the first generations. I have an Oasis, and while the form factor is great overall... I prefer the Paper White. I don't like the buttons on the Oasis and the weight is offset switching from my left and right hands without rotating the device. The 2021 Paper White is symmetrical making it easier to switch between my hands without rotating the device and has a little better battery life.

The screen on my Oasis is a little clearer though... probably because the glass is more transparent. The 2021 Paper White has a plastic screen... more susceptible to scratches, but less prone to breaking if dropped or carried around in a bag... pick your poison. I prefer the glass, but that's obviously not an option on the 2021 Paper White.

My Oasis is a 1st Gen, and has a bluish backlight. I don't think it is worth he $250+ asking price to get the latest generation with a yellower backlight (the form factor is exactly the same). However, for the Price of the Paper White, it was worth it to me... I get the yellow/blue backlighting, better battery life, and the symmetrical form factor I enjoy.",5.0
2813,"I absolutely love it. It is such an improvement over the previous generation Kindle.

I love the size and speed. I’m coming from the prior Paperwhite (2018 version, 10th generation running software 5.13.7) and really notice the greater page real estate/size as well as the page turn speed and how quickly it wakes up. These make the upgrade happily worthwhile for me.",5.0
2814,"I've had some version of a Kindle for just about as long as they've been around; as an avid reader I wouldn't be without one now. I received my new Kindle Paperwhite 11th Gen 8 GB version last week and have already downloaded hundreds of books onto it; knowing I'll never be stuck somewhere without something to read is an amazing feeling, since the larger size still fits into my medium sized purse. I'd worried some about that!

Aside from the capacity, my favorite feature hands-down is being able to adjust the warm light depending on the light in the room. Looking at a bright screen can tire out my eyes and give me headaches, and in a dark room the harsh contrast can really bother my eyes to the point I have to stop reading. The warm light option has a wide adjustment range and is just perfect for people with sensitive eyes.

I was also surprised how ""normal"" the larger size felt shortly after I started using it - more like a book as far as number of words per page - and that it's still so lightweight and easy to hold.

It's been a positive experience using it; I was hesitant to upgrade from a perfectly functional older Kindle, but am so glad I did for the above reasons.",5.0
2815,"UPDATE:

Customer service was great helping me return the original flawed unit I received. Now, that I've spent quite a while using the replacement Kindle I've got (which is perfect now) I can honestly say again that it is the best Kindle I've had to date. The inclusion of the warm light alone is worth it. It allows for a more relaxed reading experience. The size of the screen is way better than the previous model. The weight feels balanced in my hands. Overall it feels like a great step forward. I used to feel the previous model was very cutting edge, but this new 2021 model makes it feel archaic. I hope Amazon continues to astonish with the models it has in store for the future. 100% recommended.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:

This is hands down the best Kindle I've owned out of four different versions. Unfortunately the screen arrived with a line (dead pixels maybe?) where light ""bleeds"" through. It is very distracting, specially when using dark mode. I tried to ignore it, but it definitively breaks the reading immersion. I'm returning it and hoping I will get a perfect replacement. I will update this review with more details about the device and bump up the stars when this issue is resolved and can spend an honest time using the device.",5.0
2816,"Update:

I'm very happy with the Paperwhite.
Amazon sent new unit, and it automatically updated to new software shortly after I set it up.
As stated previously, it's very fast, I like the screen size, it's easy on the eyes, lightweight & easy to hold, and I'm glad they changed to the USB-C connection so I can use the same wire that I use for my phone. I've been reading more than I had in a long time now that I have it.

Update:

After reading all reviews, it's obvious that I received a Paperwhite with old software, as a number of other people did as well. My device info shows Firmware Version 5.14.0.1, but from reviews I've read outside of Amazon, I believe the new version is 5.14.1. I contacted customer service, and they are sending a replacement, which the agent said ""should"" have the new software on it. Let's hope that those of us who are getting replacements do receive units with the correct updated software.
I've decided that I do like it much more for reading than my Kindle 8 in spite of the old software.
I will update my review again after receiving the new one.

Previous Review:
Kind of disappointed. I've loved all of my Kindles, and really wanted to love my first Paperwhite.

First the good:

The screen size is nice.
The screen is easy on the eyes.
It's light weight for comfortable holding.
The USB-C is great - no more searching for the right wire.
It's fast.

Now the not so good:

UI does not look like what is shown on Amazon's Paperwhite 2021 product page. Their photo shows the ability to swipe down on the top of the screen to access the menu, but mine has a top menu that doesn't go away on the Home screen. No up or down swiping inside a book either - you need to tap the upper part of the screen to access the menu. You can only swipe left or right to turn pages. And if you accidentally touch the screen anywhere other than the top when reading, it will go to the next page, which is infinitely annoying.

Also, Amazon's photo shows navigation at the bottom of the screen to switch between Home, Library or the book you are reading, but mine has no such feature. That is something I would have liked to make navigation more convenient.

The Paperwhite doesn't seem to have page turn animation, or at least I can't find the setting for it, and neither could an Amazon rep who spent almost an hour on the phone with me regarding my issues. I realize this is my own personal preference and may not matter to other people, but it makes a difference to me. That's one thing I loved about reading on my Fire 8 - it gives the sense of reading a real book, but the Fire 8 is too slow even after cleanup and reboot, and takes forever to load a book. It's also a bit too heavy to hold for long periods of time. Although Amazon does not actually mention page turn animation in their description, according to two reviewers on Amazon, and also two independent reviews elsewhere, they do have animated page turn on their new 2021 Paperwhites. So I'd like to know how I can enable it on mine.

Two buyers commented in their reviews that they received units with old software but couldn't update to the latest version as the update option is greyed out. It's greyed out on mine as well, which I initially assumed meant that I already have the latest software, but now I'm wondering whether that may be the issue with mine. Maybe I really don't have the latest version of the software, but I can't update it.

I really had high hopes for the Paperwhite, but as of now I'm on the fence as to whether I'll keep it or go back to using my Fire 8 for reading. If I can get these things resolved, I'll happily come back to add stars and update my review.",5.0
2817,"I am a bookworm but over the last few years I've noticed I've not read any physical books. I've listened to the Audible version of many many many books and had usually always read the physical book itself as well. I read almost exclusively self-help books. So hearing the book and then following up with reading it helped really absorb/remember important points.
At first, I thought it was it was because I was gradually just relying on the Audible version that was lending to me not reading. But when I really thought about it, I realized that when it'd come time to leave the house I'd decide against taking the book with me. (I haul around a lot of stuff so that's just one less thing that would take up space in my computer bag).
Anyway and ultimately, I thought I'd try the Kindle Paperwhite and I'm SO HAPPY I did. I've already read 2 books after getting my kindle on Oct 27th.
It's important to note I've always been a hardcore ""I have to have the physical book' girl. However, with the ability to change fonts (makes the world of difference to me - not sure why), having so many screen options and (LOVE this next part) the highlighting that you can print off, I'm just totally in love with this thing. Hmmm, that means I should probably give her a name:)
And it's so lightweight! And since it doesn't take up much space and isn't heavy or bulking it's no big deal to have it everywhere I go.
I read a crap ton of reviews and many had mentioned battery life. The battery life has proven PHENOMENAL.
As far as the ease of holding it - I think that sticking a pop socket on the back will probably make it the most comfortable for me personally. It's not that it's hard to hold at all, but I'll catch that my hand is getting tired if I'm 'one-handing' it just because it's a wider grip.
P.S. I never write reviews even though I've purchased a million items on Amazon. But, reviews ALWAYS help me and I was impressed enough to want to write one. So I hope this helps someone.",5.0
2818,"I upgraded to the new model from a 2012 Paperwhite, and as expected, I've found this one to be a major leap forward.

Slow page turns were annoying on the original Paperwhite, and that's gone in the new model. I loved the Amazon leather cover on my old one, and the new cover (fabric this time) is even better. My one minor complaint is that there seem to be fewer font size choices. I'm currently fine with the medium setting, but if I have to increase, the next size up is much bigger.

For those running into issues with ads, I hit that as well - trying to turn off ads from the Devices page would just fail with a ""try again later"" message. I contacted the chat support, and the rep resolved this for me in a matter of minutes.",5.0
2819,"I just received my new Paperwhite three days ago. I pre ordered it. My Gen 6 was constantly rebooting itself, poor old thing. But I had gotten a ton of use out of it. I had read the reviews on the last one and heard some concerns so I waited for the Gen 11. I have used it for three days and love it!! I thought 0.8” difference on the screen size wouldn’t be noticeable, but it is. I read a lot in the pool on a float in the summer so being waterproof is big (although I do have a cover it will fit it if I go to the beach, for water and sand). The warm light is so nice on the eyes, and it has a function to switch it as the sun goes down. How convenient. My kindle goes to doctors appointments with long waits, to the airport, with longer waits. Fits right in my bag, and I am always entertained (without reverting to social media….which stresses me out!). Paperwhites are always my favorite because the screen is not backlit, which us hard on my eyes after a long time. Loving it already!!!!",5.0
2820,"I had the previous generation Paperwhite which I have loved and used a lot. I'd imagine that I average about 1-2 hours of reading per day. The battery life in my 2019 Paperwhite was really dwindling. In fact, if I was reading with the wifi on, I would not expect more than 12 hours of battery life. It had been a great device that would occasionally need to reboot for no apparent reason, but it was time to replace it.

So far, I am thrilled.

It is so much more responsive to touch than the last version. I hated typing anything on my kindle and only did when I needed to search for a book in the kindle store. Typing had been so slow and laggy, and often a letter would not be recognized.
This is no longer as big of a problem. It obviously is more sensitive to input by typing, and highlighting is far quicker and more accurate.

Page turning is so quick, at times I am wondering if the page even turned. Because of this, Kindle has implemented a page turning animation that actually helps you see the page turn. At first, I thought the page turn animation would just be a gimmick, but it actually is necessary because of how responsive the page turn feature is.

Being a bit larger screen, it is helpful that I can widen the margins to keep a similar width for quicker and easier reading.

My only complaint is that the bezel is becoming so small, you feel like you need to hold the edge more carefully. This took a little getting used to and then I didn't need to think about it. A suggestion that I'd make to Amazon is to incorporate a setting that would allow the reader to modify how much of the screen is touch sensitive so that you can widen the margins and touch the page without turning to the next page. Another thought is that Amazon might want to develop an ergonomic cushioned attachment that makes gripping the device a little more comfortable.

It definitely feels like a good upgrade over the last model. Even the battery seems to have a higher capactiy. I read yesterday with the wifi on for over 3 hours and was still at 95% battery. It's somewhat misleading when Amazon claims that the battery lasts for weeks. I use a kindle pretty much daily, and I like to have the wifi on so that it sinks up with my audible library. I was usually charging my last paperwhite 2x per week. I'll be interested to see how this compares after a little bit of time. Moving to USB-C is very appealing. I'll be glad to be 100% done with micro USB, not to mention the faster charging times will be very welcome.

Overall, I'm very happy with the new device. All of the upgrades seems useful and not at all gimmicky. It's a lot more device for about the same amount of money.",5.0
2821,"The latest Kindle PaperWhite, is so much better than the previous PaperWhite. It is so much faster, the upgraded WiFi and screen are just wonderful. I have been using Kindle E-ink devices since I believe 2009. I have had the Kindle KB, the Voyage, and the Oasis 2, and a number of PaperWhites and Basic Kindles. This PW is the best of the group for me. The screen size is great, and it is so easy to see and read on. This PW is so much faster, and page turns are fast and smooth. Downloads almost happen instantaneously. The updated LED lighting is even across the whole screen. I also received the cloth cover, in blue that matches the cover of my Fire HD 10 plus. When I got the Fire tablet I was expecting to never again get another Kindle E-ink device, but am I so glad that I talked myself into getting this PW. I didn’t get the special edition because I don’t need the 32 gigs, and the wireless charging. I am 74 years young and I read close to 100 books a year, most of them are Kindle Unlimited books.

For the ones that have complained that this PW doesn’t do something, like playing games, and some of the other things I have read, let me say this the Kindles, PW, and the Oasis, etc, were all created to be ebook readers, nothing more nothing less. This PW does what it was intended to do so great.

I believe that the developers decided to not include the Cellular capability because WiFi has become available almost everywhere, I find that I can find an WiFi HotSpot even where I cannot find Cellular signals.

Now I am not someone that jailbreaks my devices even though I could in most cases. I am a retired IT Professional that has chosen to really retire and walk away from the job I use to do. So I do not wish to were about devices drivers or any of that anymore.

After well over a month of use this new Paper White Kindle, I have to say it is the very best Kindle that I have owned, and I have owned basic Kindles, KB, Voyage, and Oasis. This PW5 is fast and very comfortable to use with the Amazon Kindle cloth cover. I highly recommend it.",5.0
2822,"I had the 2018, which I absolutely loved. My reading increased 300%. The only complaint I had was the screen took a moment to respond. It was frustrating only when I needed to type or access a book. Page-turning was tolerable, but switching books was inconvenient.

This one reacts much quicker and it even feels like I don't need to press hard at all. Single-handed page turning is a breeze. The screen is also noticeably larger, but it's still super light and easy to hold one handed. The warm light has a schedule too, if you want, and I love that. I'm so glad I upgraded.",5.0
2823,"The amber light alone has been worth the upgrade. I can read for longer in the dark, and it is more comfortable. It is also faster than the 2018 paperwhite, and the bigger screen makes it a better experience altogether. Mine came with the latest firmware. I recommend trading in your old kindle and upgrade to this version. It’s worth it.",5.0
2824,"I am on my second Kindle Paperwhite 5 because I didn't like it the first time around. I didn't like it mainly because it was very slippery to hold and the margins are small. It was hard to keep a grip on it.

However I decided to give it a second try and I just got a case with a strap on the back and a lap holder that can hold any device. I don't know what it is called but it was only $20 and I love it. I also have a sleeve for when I use just the case with the handle on the back. I love the case that has just the back part too. It makes a difference this time.

The second Kindle I got also has no pinholes. That was another issue I had with the first one.

I do miss having buttons but I do still have the Kobo Libra 2 for that fix. I have a hard time choosing between which device is better so I am keeping both still.

The Paperwhite 5 is still better than the Kindle Oasis ever was to me. It has a better battery life, no ghosting issues and the battery doesn't drain. It's also easier to hold now that I have better accessories.

It's a four star rating.",5.0
2825,"I love this thing. To be fair, I loved my old kindle too, but this was definitely worth upgrading for. It is everything the product description says it is, no need to repeat that here. My old 2015 7th gen was working 100% but I was tempted when I saw that the new ones had warm amber lighting. It’s a small thing, but I read mostly at night, in bed, in the dark, while my SO sleeps, and this really does make reading easier on my eyes. And on that point it’s great. The touchscreen is also a drastic improvement over the 7th gen.

The size surprised me. The product descriptions make it clear that this one is about a quarter inch taller and wider, which I didn’t love, though I definitely do love the bigger screen. But what wasn’t clear until I had it in hand is that they took back most of that increase with a more minimalist case! So comparing the two products in the case, the new one is the exact same height, about an eighth of an inch wider, and it’s actually noticeably thinner. I haven’t taken my old one out of its case in six years, so if you’re like me then don’t worry about this, they are are effectively the same size.

I can also report, as others have noted, that if you buy the bundle the items ship separately. So the shipping time listed for the bundle is NOT accurate. If you want to know when you’ll get them, look to the individual product pages, those were accurate for me. The bundle said 3-5 weeks, but I got my case in two days, the kindle arrived in four days, and apparently the charging block (I.e. the most useless piece of the bundle) it the only item that will take 3-5 weeks to arrive.",5.0
2826,"I love the bigger screen of this kindle and the ability to adjust the warmness of the light. Those are my two favorite features. I also love the USB-C charging.

However,
I’m starting to miss the ability to hold my kindle on one hand, especially at night as I read.

I don’t like that the device had to be made bigger, when the last paperwhite’s size had more than enough space to include the same exact 6.8” screen.

The weight is not that uncomfortable, but it starts to become noticeable if you read for a couple of hours back to back.

Not only that, we still have the same sensitive and easily scratchable screen. I have already gotten a scratch on it, and I am not even sure if it came like that out of the box. Those tiny glowing white scratches are very distracting, especially when reading at night with the black setting.

All in all, yes it is a great device, but it would be a lot more worth the money if those issues that have been around for years would finally be addressed.

I have covered a more detail review in our youtube video in the account Duo.Armonia.",5.0
2827,"I’ve only had it a few days, but so far it’s great. It is much more comfortable reading on this kindle rather than the Fire Tablet. The size is great and feels comfortable while holding.

It just seems like you can’t remove audible titles from the device without going through somewhere else and permanently deleting them. I want them, I just don’t want to see them on this device. Also, I wish you could read and listen to books at the same time. Connecting to the internet is a nice feature, but not good enough to use frequently.

Space does not seem like it will be an issue unless you plan on buying thousands of books or having hundreds of audible books on there at the same time.

I would recommend this to any reader or someone who needs a kick in the pants to read more. You can even connect to the library and send books to your kindle for free. Get the ad free version. In the long run, I think you’ll be happy with that decision.",5.0
2828,"I never intended on buying another Kindle. Along came Prime Day. I grabbed this for about 100 bucks.

In terms of the need of wireless charging for this? You have to be kidding. The battery life is go good on this (I read a novel and used 12 percent of battery) that connecting it once every 4-6 weeks is hardly an inconvenience. I am thrilled without this option.

I'd like to offer a comparison between this Paperwhite and the Kobo Sage. There is not a better engineered EReader for holding in the hand than that one. It's expensive. Where the Kindle wins is clearly in battery life. Kobo wins with the user experience, however it's battery life is disappointing and in line with the 1st EReaders introduced. But unless you are on a lengthy period away from charging - this is a non issue.

The best bang for the buck?? Paperwhite. If you have never owned one, or want to upgrade? You will not be disappointed.

If money is no object, the Kobo Sage is the premier EReader right now. Despite its shortcomings, it's difficult to forget its ease in library borrowing, as well as the amazing feel in hand. Amazon still has not gotten that quite right. Not by comparison.",5.0

2831,"Okay so it’s only been a few weeks and it works great I haven’t needed to charge often. I got to sync the kindle app on my phone with my kindle and it works great. I keep reading anywhere and don’t lose my place in a book. That being said I found it more enjoyable because I had kindle unlimited. Which is good for testing out books before buying the physical hardcover or paperbacks. I haven’t changed the lighting because the current setting doesn’t bother me. Now like any product extras come separately. You need to buy the wall outlet separately, the case and the screen protectors just like you would for any computer or phone. I like the size of it. And it’s not heavy, very light weight. The touch screen is okay, its not anything fancy but I don’t hate it. So far so good, I’m hoping they do a color one in the future but that’s simply for aesthetic reasons rather than anything else. Price wise I would say you get what you pay for. I got it on sale for Black Friday and doing monthly payments, my first time trying out that feature. Compared to a nook, which costs about maybe thirty dollars less and other than a color screen does not offer an unlimited reading plan so you have to buy the books or get only the free books which aren’t usually by very well known authors. Since I have both, I will say I’ve used my kindle more in the first three weeks than my nook. Definitely worth a try.",4.0
2832,"I love, love, love my KIndle. And I love this Paperwhite. Not only can I take my entire library with me and only carry the single device, but I can program it so that reading is like picking up the hard over or paperback -- a creamy colored background with black type -- and adjust more than just backgrounds and type. A battery that lasts 12 hours or more gives me ample time to read a book before I need to recharge. A brilliant piece of technology and mine is no exception. I love it. I still love my hard covers and paperbacks but having this with me is easy and convenient. I love my Kindle!!",4.0
2833,"I'm very pleased with my purchase. I've debated for years on whether or not to get an e-reader at all. I made the decision to try to spend less on books and I believe that having this Kindle will help me do that. I have not seen a 10-week-long battery life just yet but it does last quite long. I've charged it once since I received it Dec. 3. I really enjoy all the features this new Paperwhite comes with especially the USB-C and the adjustable warmth light. I decided on just getting a skin instead of a cover and I'm happy with that. It's a little wide for my tiny hands but it works just perfect. 😋 I enjoy the reading experience on this device more than I ever did on a tablet or my phone. Besides my red dragon plush that my mother got me this is my favorite Christmas present.
Cons: I don't like that the power button is on the bottom. When I put it on a stand it cuts on and off. I don't know why they didn't put the power button on the side or the top. Hopefully they will move the power button to a more convenient spot in future versions.",4.0
2834,"I’m not sure why I waited as long as I have to buy a Kindle but I absolutely love it. Shipping did take much longer than I had expected but I’m also very impatient. I don’t have any prior models to compare it to but as an avid user of much larger tablet devices I will say the Kindle’s features make reading such a breeze! It’s lighter than my current cell phone and the adjustability of the screen and the many options you have for visibility is very accommodating. I have yet to read outside due to the current temperatures but I’m looking forward to hitting the hammock come spring and being able to read without a glare! Lastly, I wouldn’t say I have small hands, I guess average for a woman, but I did add a phone grip to the back and it has made a world of difference in holding the Kindle more comfortably. If you’ve read this far, just buy it! You won’t regret it!",4.0

I got so used to my trusty old Kindle being a little sluggish, I was pleasantly surprised at how seamlessly this version “turns” the page. The bigger screen is so nice, and the ability to change the warmth of the backlight in addition to the brightness is spot on; when I’m reading in bed at night, a dim warm light is a nice option. The only con I’ve found (and it’s really not a very big one) is the flush screen and the quick page refresh make it easy to accidentally change the page when I don’t mean to. Otherwise, it’s a great device. I love it.",4.0
2837,"This is such a clear upgrade from the 2018 edition! I was a bit skeptical at first because I bought the 2018 paperwhite during the prime sale in October 2020. However, I caved in for the better battery, the warm light and bigger screen.

What I like so far:
The screen is noticeable bigger and it feels strange but a good strange because I love it!

I really love how much more responsive the screen is for this e reader! Doesn't seem so cluncky!

I love the adjustable warm light feature! You can set the time for warm light automatic or you can manually changed the time!

Brightness! This paperwhite clearly is much brighter compared to the the 2018 paperwhite!

USB-C charging and wireless charging ( paperwhite signature edition)! Though I wouldn't upgrade to this paperwhite for this feature alone but it's an awesome plus because I swear I have like 20 USB-C cords and like no micro USB cords. With nearly every device using USB-C, this feature is a really good perk!

Battery life! Amazon claims 10 weeks with 30 mintues of reading each day. I can comment on the battery life personally for me yet. However, I expect even witu reading for 60-90 mintues, you probably won't have to charge it but once a month! Which is still amazing!!

I think the only cons I have about this paperwhite is no option for other colors. I would like to have a choice of a few different colors. Another con is there isn't a 32 gb option for the standard option. You'd have to get the signature edition for the extra storage.

Overall, this upgrade is worth the extra $10!!!",4.0

Pros:

- perfect size for holding for long periods
- can read for extended periods of time without hurting my eyes
- the battery just keeps going and going
- Amazon offers tons of great case options

Cons:

- the navigation and the user interface is a little confusing

For anybody who loves reading I would definitely suggest picking up a Kindle it's takes up almost no space and you don't have to have clutter with tons of books or worry about your books being ruined. I missed reading and ever since I got my Kindle I read every other day at least and don't look at my phone so much!",4.0

You may have read on the internet that the Kids version is the same as the Adults but is considerably less expensive. Maybe so but not on Black Friday when I ordered mine.
Minor quibble: I'm not sure the instruction manual is up to date. The first book I read on my new Kindle showed all the underlinings from other readers and I didn't know how to clean them off. I also like seeing the time on each page but it was only on the home page. I couldn't find answers in the manual. I contacted Amazon on line and a very helpful customer service person showed me what to do. (Click on the Aa settings.) All is now well and I'm happy.",4.0
2840,"Two things. First off, I have been using the new Kindle Paperwhite 11 exclusively the last week or so and I have to say... They may have finally created the PERFECT eReader. Battery life is amazing, the screen looks amazing, the warm light feature is super nice but I tend not to use it because I get sleepy😂, and the page turn animations are snazzy. I wasn't too sure about the size when it first came out because I was afraid it would be heavier, but it's truly not. I have RA and it doesn't hurt my wrist or fingers even after long sessions of holding it while reading. So yeah.... It's super close to being absolutely perfect. I don't really have anything negative at all to say about it at this point, besides I don't care for the flush screens (fingerprints galore) I liked bezels. That's all though.

2841,"I had a kindle about 9 years ago and just could not get on with it. I found it really cumbersome to navigate, the light was awful, it just was not an enjoyable experience at all.

I figured I would try one again given that tech can change a lot in 9 years. Oh my goodness! I don’t think I will ever go back to reading paper books again. The dark mode is wonderful for late night reading, the touchscreen is so responsive, the page turns are practically instant, it’s so easy to navigate. I love that I can adjust the lighting and warmth. This is a completely different device to the earlier Kindles. It is an absolute joy to use, and if I lost it, or broke it, I would not hesitate to get another one right away.

My single only complaint is the rubber like coating on the back. I think I would enjoy using the kindle without a case, but the back attracts such ugly smudges and marks that I can’t stand to look at it. It’s absolutely not a dealbreaker, but the only thing that could do with a change.",4.0

From the picture you can see I have the 2018 paperwhite it's more portable being that it's smaller my only con and it doesn't happen often enough is sometimes it freezes and restart and randomly upgrading it's system but that doesn't bother me I hope in the future will be fixed! I can definitely say that I don't think I'll want the oasis because this is bigger than my hand and warmlight is all I desired! Now my boyfriend wants a kindle since I love my devices so much,4.0
2843,"I gave this Paperwhite 5*s because so far I like it!!!! I have had several kindle’s, my last Paperwhite being a 7th generation. I was completely satisfied with my 7th generation but wanted something newer so I ordered the new 11th generation Paperwhite. Glad I did.
I have to say that the viewing area does seem to be the perfect size. The lighting is soothing or more book like or less harsh, etc. Can't really put my finger on it other than to say reading seems effortless. I have been checking the 11 against my 7 side by side and it's a huge improvement. I like it.
I have not experienced fuzziness or any of the other reviewers issues but have only had my 11 for a few days.
The waterproofing and ability to listen to audio via blue tooth are not high on my list of e-reader priorities but they're nice to have.
The software upgrades are a huge improvement. But of course they are also available on my 7 for the most part. The 11 screen does seem to be more responsive than on my 7 despite it having the same software updates.
I am happy I made the move to the 11 and you will be too. Try it you'll like it!!
BTW I did not buy the kindle cover but I did buy another vendor’s cover. I highly recommend buying a cover for your device. I do not enjoy reading on my kindle without a cover it makes it feel more book like to me but that's really just personal preference. If you buy a cover make sure it's for the 11th generation as covers for earlier generations will *not* fit.

It’s super fast, the screen is larger which makes it feel like it can capture an entire physical book page. I removed the ads which makes it more personal. And displayed my cover. The warm light is great to balance with the brightness. Make sure to turn on screen refresh especially if you enjoy comics or manga. The size is a bit larger, which is hard to hold since I have small hands but I put a clear case, and a clear ring holder in the back and now it’s absolutely perfect. I have zero complaints.

2850,"I have been reading books on my iPad mini for years, and have always loved it. However, I’ve started noticing more headaches and wondered if it was possibly from always being in front of a bright screen. I thought it was worth trying the Paperwhite, because from what I read, the e-ink screen would be easier on my eyes. I just received it yesterday, and I am already in love with this thing. It looks great and my eyes seem to “relax” when I’m reading on it. Added bonus is that I’ll be able to read outside in the sun this summer, which doesn’t work with the iPad. Another great thing I hadn’t even considered is how much lighter it is. Reading while laying in bed is a much more comfortable experience. For those wondering, checking out books from the library is super easy - you do need to use another device to check your books out, but then the app will send it to the Kindle. The one thing that will take some getting use to is the screen refresh when you move around in the system - it threw me off a little when I first saw it, but I get why it does it. It’s not nearly as noticeable while reading. Anyhow, great product - I love it, and will update if there is any change down the road. Happy Reading!",5.0

I am more for physical books however due to travel this comes in very very handy when you cant carry all your books to another town, city, country etc.

About the service from Amazon - this was delayed so they gave me a full refund!!!
Later, i reached out to the customer care when i received the product ( 1 day after refund.)
Anddd let me keep the cover i bought with this for free!! and asked if i could return the product.

But look at that service!! The moment it was delayed i got a refund.
So i could actually go to another store and buy.

Service is the main reason i keep coming back to amazon. kudos!",5.0
2854,"Crisp brilliant display, long battery life and a very comfortable holding weight. Amazon doesn’t mess around with it’s kindles. They are designed to be the best, and to give you the best user experience. Amazon happens to hit the mark on all of those things. Not only that, but I’m really enjoying having the warm light implanted into the new era of kindles. As you can see from my picture hopefully, the text is amazingly crisp and sharp. Page turns are nice and quick…. And battery life is really outstanding. I would highly recommend this unit to everyone. Oh, and having the USB-C charging port is also a welcome feature over the old kindles. Can’t go wrong with purchasing one.",5.0
2855,The amber lighting is much easier on my eyes ( I have at 3/4s on the adjustment scale). The Increased height of the screen adds a couple more lines of text on the page making it look and more a regular printed book. Page turning is quicker and longer battery like is good. Overall I give a 5 star rating! Pat B.,5.0
2856,"I had this e-ink reader in a sony model years ago. I bought this for my wife to read in the sun and low light rooms, bedroom etc. The edgelight is excellent and the device smoothly joins the Wi-Fi an allowed her to access our existing Amazon library seamlessly. I am extremely please with the reader and plan to buy one for myself as well. This reader replaces a mac - ipad which is probably 3x as heavy and you cannot read the iPad at the beach. With this reader you can. I recommend this over the base model due to the improved edge lighting which i find easy and eyepleasing .",5.0
2857,"So far I'm extremely pleased with this new paperwhite. I like the size of the page, it responds quickly for turning pages and the letters are crisp and clear easy to read. I didn't realize how much I appreciate the wireless charging. But I love that and it even charges through my case.
The pages turn smoothly and I like the option to display the time at the top of the page.",5.0
2858,"When my husband took over my old Paperwhite, I got this one, and I love it. It's easy to hold, easy to use, and the battery life is phenomenal. Avid readers need this great tool. Read at night. Adjust the text size. So many books at your fingertips. I love the waterproof aspect because we camp and go to the beach a lot. Just a great thing. If you read, you need this.",5.0

2860,"If you're like me, you are getting pretty tired of looking at the stack of books that are spilling onto the floor. My husband bought me a Kindle and I wasn't thrilled. I love the feeling of a real book in my hands, so I thought Id hate this. I was so wrong. This holds, reads, and feels like a book (with the foldable cover- sold separately) I love to read in bed at night, and my traditional book light is so bright and likely contributes to my insomnia. The Kindle has both a day and night feature with controlled brightness. It has a warm and subtle backlight. With Kindle Unlimited, I've been able to transfer several of my traditional bound books to my Kindle for $9 per month.",5.0
2861,"I love my Kindle. I'm not sure how people review it negatively. It downloads the books I want to read, and it lets me read them without making my eyes tired like physical books do. That's all I asked for. Plus, the light settings are great. Day mode and night mode are useful.",5.0
2862,"I am a book purist and put off buying a Kindle despite friends raving about them. I still prefer tangible books but I have to say I'm in love with this device. I find myself reaching for the Kindle more than my books just for the ease of use, built in light and font enlargement features. A quick tutorial on YouTube had me up to speed with all the other awesome options. Highly recommend this especially if you are a frequent traveler. No more lugging around several heavy books in your carry-on! The only negative is photos come over in black & white but it's not a deal-breaker for the convenience it offers!",5.0
2863,"Finally decided to upgrade from my 2011 Kindle and all I can say is that I am very glad that I did. The upgrades are so much better considering there is a 10 year gap between both devices. Definitely recommend those who have much older models to upgrade or if you’re new to kindle. It feels great to be able to read in the dark and have touch screen. Overall very happy with my purchase, no complaints.",5.0
2864,"I was giving this for mother's day! I love ❤ it. I like that I can set the level of whiteness of the screen, I get migraines and bright white gives me a headache. I have the brightness on auto, but I can turn it down. I get blurred vision from back lit screens, the kindle is better. I can still have blurry vision when I use it for a few hours but the strain is much less pronounced. It's light weight and easy to use. The only issue I have is getting back to the home screen, the kindle keeps opening the books information, so it takes mea few tries to get it right.",5.0
2865,"I have been a Kindle user since generation one. I've loved them all for what they were but this Kindle finally made me say ""YES! THANK YOU, AMAZON! THIS IS THE ONE!!""

The screen is a little larger, it's waterproof, the touch screen works better than any of the other Kindles I've had and I can adjust my reading experience in more ways than ever now (brightness and fonts as I always could but now I can adjust the light warmth too) I it charges quickly (finally a better charging cord). I love it!!",5.0
2866,This works great once you are reading. At night if you want to turn the screen black you can change it to black to read. I just keep learning as I go. I think part of it is I bought a horrible book to read first. It makes me not want to read at all. I have to get another book. Practice with that book. I do like the kindles battery life. I have only charged it once in I guess a month. I think that is pretty cool. My other kindles were very needy and the battery was crying to be charged. I hope this last a long time.,5.0
2867,"2nd Kindle I've owned- Faster than older versions, sleek, and long lasting battery. Ads don't bother me at all since they're only on the homescreen and I see them only when connected to the internet and when I open the Kindle. I love it!",5.0
2868,Started using in January 2022 - screen froze showing Kindle logo - could not turn off. Would recharge and stay stuck on fozen screen till battery ran out again. Reader was kept in a protective case and was never dropped or exposed to water or any harmful elements - basically kept in bedroom on night stand. Tried all the recommended restart and reboot processes recommended by Amazon. They did honor their warranty and shipped me a new one recently. Hopefully this one will last a reasonable amount of time.,5.0
2869,"I've had a Paperwhite for over 8 years and have never felt any need to upgrade. However, the Prime Days deal on this latest model was so good that I couldn't pass it up. The new features are worth it to me -- slightly larger screen that actually makes a big difference, more robust library management software, and an adjustable amber light setting that is more enjoyable than I anticipated. Plus the battery life is pretty astounding. I've only charged it once so far since purchasing it.",5.0
2870,"It may not seem like a big difference but for people who suffer with eye strain, this is a game changer!

The touch screen is also more responsive and easier to work. Definitely worth the upgrade.",5.0

2872,"This is my third or fourth Paperwhite. It's bigger, faster and lighter than the previous generations. Pages turn faster. Well, everything is faster. The user interface is a little clunky and there's an annoying learning curve. Not that well thought out, IMO, but it's still worth the trouble. Amazon dropped the ball on the cases to protect it so you may wish to look around for something that doesn't require you to auction off your first born child to pay for a case that is just not up to par.",5.0

But I wanted to give it a try again and get the newest Paperwhite, and I’m very happy with my decision.
It’s waaaaaay getting better and I always have a great reading experience with it.
It’s little too big for my hand but I use a popsocket.
Also I could connect to my Japanese Amazon account very easily. So do not hesitate to get it if you live in US but wanna read books with your language.",5.0

2879,"I used to rip on people who read ebooks, stating that it isn't the same experience as reading a physical book. While I still stand by part of that statement, I have read more books with this Kindle the past year than I have in years past.

The new Paperwhite is even better. The screen looks better - seems crisper to me. I think it also feels a little faster when turning pages.

2885,"Originally I ordered the kindle fire 7, but after realizing that I really only wanted the kindle for reading and not the internet or games I decided to cancel the order and get the paperwhite. The battery life is the biggest plus for me! I’m someone who reads for hours upon hours at a time so the kindle fire with its 7 hours of battery life just wasn’t going to cut it! I am so in love with my new kindle. If you’re someone who reads often or in different lighting I would definitely recommend getting a kindle instead of a fire tablet. The paper finish is so much easier on the eyes than the tablet screen. It also has warm light and a night mode for an even more enjoyable experience. I couldn’t be happier! The only thing I wish it came with is a charging block. With the price point it seems like they could easily include one, but overall it is worth every penny!",5.0
2886,"I love this device. I've always wanted a bigger screen for my e-reader and this new paperwhite has just that. I updated from my 2nd generation paperwhite so I love that this one has a flushed screen. I haven't reached 0% on the battery so I don't know how long it lasts but I've read positive reviews saying that it's insanely long so I'm looking forward to it. The page turning is noticeably faster and the warmth adjustment is really nice too. I love that I can save my favorite font, font size, text spacing as a ""theme"". I read in both English and Vietnamese and the text in Vietnamese is always tighter so having this theme option is really convenient since I don't have to readjust the font or spacing every time. Overall I really love this device and would recommend it for anyone who wants to update from the 3rd or previous generations of paperwhite or from a normal kindle. If you currently have the 4th generation I don't think it's worth the update since it's quite expensive.",5.0
2887,I really like how responsive the screen is. I upgraded from a previous version of paperwhite and I can definitely see a big difference.

I also like how it feels when I am reading and it’s ergonomically comfortable.,5.0

The warm light setting is a game changer for reading before bedtime if you have sensitive eyes like me. My only complaint is that the screen acquires smudges fairly easily. Not a big deal but I catch myself getting distracted by them when I’m reading. I paired my kindle with the lavender haze case which is cute and comfortable.

It's so lightweight that it is easy to hold in whatever position you're most comfortable in. The backlight is excellent in the brightest sunlight or in the darkest room. I'll be transparent - if I didn't use this primarily with library books that are coming and leaving my library, the library portion of the Kindle could be slightly annoying just because you can't freely scroll.
It's not worth it to pay the extra money for the ads. It's literally just books being recommended when the screen is locked, and if you buy the leather case for it, it'll be covered up.
I love mine and think it's worth every penny!",5.0

3013,"The Kindle Paperwhite is an exceptional e-reader that has been upgraded to offer an even better reading experience. The 6.8"" display is larger than before and provides a clear and crisp display that makes reading a pleasure. The adjustable warm light feature is a game-changer, it allows to adjust the color temperature of the screen to match the ambient light in the room, so you can read comfortably in any lighting condition.

I've had my Kindle for just 3 days and I've already read 4 books. The 8 GB of storage is more than enough for most readers, it can store thousands of books, audiobooks, and magazines. The battery life is also impressive, it lasts for several weeks on a single charge. The device is also waterproof, so you can read by the pool or in the bath without any worries.

The Kindle Paperwhite is lightweight, easy to hold, and easy to use. The touch screen is responsive and the page turn buttons make it easy to navigate through your books. The device also has built-in wifi, so you can easily download new books, audiobooks, and magazines.

Overall, the Kindle Paperwhite is an excellent e-reader that offers a great reading experience. The adjustable warm light, larger display, and the ability to store thousands of books make it a great option for anyone looking for an e-reader that is easy to use, provides a great reading experience, and allows you to read a lot of books in a short amount of time.",5.0

3034,"I tried again 5/15 with Japanese text. After two pages, page would not turn. After a minute, it restarted. Finally, it went back to open page. When I tried to open my Japanese book again, blank screen. I will have to manually restart. Since the Japanese text is the main reason I got the new Kindle, I have to give it a 1 and go back to my 2018 Kindle Paperwhite.

Twice I had to close the cover to shut down the device, when it stopped responding. Once, I had to reset it, when the Japanese book I was reading did not open and could not be removed from the device. But, it opens books clearly faster than my kindle 10th.

It seems to have settled down, but I am keeping the shipping package just in case I decide to return it.

Still freezing and re-booting way to often. The 2018 Paperwhite is no better. I never used to have this problem. Did they update the operating system or something.

The only complaint I have so far is the battery. They said the battery lasts 10 weeks depending on how much you read. I am guessing that it lasts that long if you have it but don't read it at all. I have owned this Kindle for 5 days and have already had to plug it in twice to charge it. Granted I have been totally immersed into a series and have barely put the Kindle down, except for one day I didn't read that much out of it.

The display has a paper like quality I enjoy a great deal, and is easy on the eye with adjustable font and features that are easily customized. At night, it's nice to use dark mode with some illumination of the text, making this perfect for reading in the dark, or for reading in bright sunlight. Highly recommended. Don't waste money having the ads turned off... they're not intrusive, and only display when the unit is off or waking up.

I've been reading daily on my phone using the Kindle app, but I constantly found myself switching over to scroll through social media.

The Paperwhite was a great purchase. It's easy to read, and the screen is a great size. The font options are so clear and crisp on the screen. While there is no page turn buttons like on other devices, I've found the screen to be perfectly sensitive to my touch and even the gentlest tap has the page turning. The warm light option has been great for reading in different lighting.

I've been reading a lot on it (several hours a day or more), and I'm still getting ten days or so of reading out of a full battery. Reading on my phone always drove the battery down quickly, so getting this much life out of a single charge means I know I will always have a book at hand.",5.0

It felt a bit frivious to me at first to make this purchase, since I never really read that much. My husband kept pointing out....I could use my tablet to read......but for some reason I was really drawn to the idea of owning a Kindle Paperwhite. At Christmas, I received a gift card and I thought, ""Ok, now is my time to take the plunge and make this purchase."" I made the purchase and have not regretted it one bit. I have become a reading addict in these few short months. I have flown through about 30 books so far. I love my Kindle Paperwhite so much, that I don't even pick up my tablet anymore. I no longer waste my free time playing mindless games or watchin videos on my tablet, I just want to read the next great find on my Kindle. I LOVE the antiglare screen of the Kindle. Before I purchased this, I was afraid that I would not like the smaller size of the screen, but honestly, since owning the device it has not been a concern. The battery life is amazing. Easy to navigate. Lighter to hold and prop up when reading in bed. The glow of the screen makes it easy to read in the dark, but doesn't emit the blue light that interrupts sleep cycles. Purchasing the Kindle Paperwhite has brought me so much joy. It was definitely one of my best purchases. If you are on the fence and trying to rationalize that you don't need to spend the money because you have a tablet that you can use, just take the leap. I am glad that I did.

The paperwhite gives you the superpower of being able to read in the dark. This is my fourth one, the battery finally died in the last one, a gen7 paperwhite. This one is marginally better in several areas but not enough to make it worth an upgrade. If your paperwhite is working, don’t bother.

As someone who reads 3+ hours a day (I don't watch TV unless it's an episode of Snapped or Top Chef) I will say that the battery life is great and it has been a breeze getting all of the books I've bought directly from authors on BookFunnel onto my new Paperwhite.",5.0

3090,"I got this as a gift for my father but set it up beforehand, so I got to test it out and see for myself how it renders out text. Wow! I have to say I was astounded as to how clear and sharp the text is. I and everyone in the family either has or have had a number of e-readers over the years, and this version is a major leap ahead. This is what I think everyone always was hoping for: real PRINT quality display technology!

The backlight feature is handy of course and it's nice that they've added more granular steps from ""no light"" to fully lit. The size (of width and length) is essentially what you'd get for a standard paperback book and is very light weight (but not cheap feeling). Personally, I'd love to see a ""trade paperback"" sized version (something around 5"" x 8"") but this one is certainly more than adequate. I haven't been able to truly put the battery life to the test, but experience with other Kindle Paperwhite readers tells me that this one will perform just as advertised.

My only wish would be to have the screen another half-inch higher, in order to have some of the controls always ""available"" instead of hidden. That's probably the one aspect of the interface that could be improved; certain settings or functions are not always very intuitive (and I've been using Kindles for years). Still, it's a relatively minor complaint because everything else about this device is amazing.",5.0

3092,"I received this for my birthday from my sweet sister a couple of days ago. It is larger than the other Kindles that I am used to, so I have ordered a clear case for the back and will put a pop-socket on it to make holding it easier. Men probably wouldn't need a pop-socket, since there hands are usually bigger. The larger screen is nice since there is more text on the page. The pages are responsive and quick for an eReader with e-ink. You certainly couldn't turn a physically page in a book faster. I don't usually use a warm light for reading, but tried it out and it is very nice. It has all of the features of most of the Kindles except self-adjusting warm light which if fine for most. The battery life is going to be the best, upgrade (to me) I have read on and off for two days now and have only used 9% of the battery power. Normally on the previous generation Paperwhite I would have used at least 20% or more. I think in a power outtage this would last a few days if you were doing not stop reading, so that's awesome! The only thing that I would like to see is a smaller version of this Paperwhite for a buying option, but that is just my preference for portability. This is certainly portable and lightweight, but you couldn't put it in a shirt or normal pants pocket. If you want all the bells and whistles and like a larger size, then you can't go wrong with this Kindle. It performs well and it's water resistant. For those who say it's glitchy, TURN OFF your Page Refresh button under device options. You'll have less flashing (which happens with e-ink readers) and you wont notice it when reading or turning the page. All in all a great eReader device!",5.0
3093,"My first kindle was the old school QWERTY keyboard. Then I moved on to the 2016 one. The battery for my first one was noticeably better, however, after so many years, it stopped working, hence the 2016 version. Now I’ve moved onto the 2021 version and it was so worth it. Firstly, it just looks like a much more modern product. It’s faster, the screen is just as crisp (300ppi), and it uses a usb-c charger which will be a requirement going forward for all products in the European Union (so it’s also great for traveling - you just need an adaptor for the wall, not a converter as the charger holds 110-240V). The battery life is great as well (can’t remember vs my keyboard one, but better than 2016 one). This thing really is a beauty. It also chargers must faster than the prior version. From 15% to 100% in probably 3-4 hours. (I plugged it in when it was at 22% and it reached 58% in 40min for what it’s worth.)
I’ll be honest, my 2016 one worked just fine. I just wanted an upgrade this time. And the money back from mailing the old one back was a good push. 5 stars.",5.0

I love all the ways you can customize the kindle to meet your reading needs. Personally, I changed the setting to black with light-colored lettering. I also switched the font to dyslexia one. I never knew I could read so fast and my comprehension has improved.

I carry my kindle with me as much as my phone. So I can always read a couple of pages when I have a moment. It is so easy to read inside or out.

3129,"1. Physical Differences
- 2021 charging port is USB-C vs microUSB my older 2017 .
- 2021's screen is completely flush like a smartphone and the 2017 has bordered plastic housing.
- 2021's Kindle front logo's font color on the bezel chin is dark gray and the 2017 is a black gloss color (think black car with black aftermarket rims. I actually liked this more than 2021).
- 2021's dimensions are slightly bigger with thinner bezels for more reading and less page turning.
- 2021's housing is surrounded by a more firm rubber Velcro feeling texture than the older model.

2. Battery Life
- 2021's screen has been on for about 15 minutes not and the battery has not dropped yet. Can't say the same about the older model since its a few years old.

3. Software
- 2021's more up-to-date CPU wins but its not night a day which may be due to e-ink technology. Don't expect some kind of M1 MacBook or AMD 5 series GUI (interface) responsiveness if this is your first e-ink device.
- 2021 has dark mode and Bluetooth. These are new features for me and I'll figure out how to make best of the new tools.

First impression thoughts: Minor upgrade overall but I knew that going in. I'm not a fan of the extra real estate but I'll learn to live with it. If you're a frequent traveler, I'd stick to the older models for easier travel storage (interior coat pocket to fanny packs). To me, personally, it isn't worth the 130.00+ retail especially only if you don't already have a previous gen. If you haven one yet then this year's model is worth it for the USB-C and better battery life- just wait on a good holiday deal. I got mine today with a price discount from last week plus additional discounts by trading in my 2017 for 20% off + 25.00 Amazon Credits.",5.0

3141,"I've had several Kindles for more than a decade now, going all the way back to the Kindle Keyboard. I usually replace them just to get desirable new features, and also because the trade-in/trade-up is always a good deal. I read a lot every single day, up to 50 books a year in the past few years by balancing my attention away from so much toxic social media and taking advantage of Kindle Unlimited. It's easy to get consumed by having a shiny device in your hand with infinite bites of short-attention-span content, taking all your attention away from reading a good book or even enjoying a good show or movie. The Kindle Paperwhite is an aesthetically pleasing and covetable device that you can turn to for the experience of a beautifully printed page with crisp clean fonts and no paywalls popping up or asking you turn off your ad blocker or accept cookies, or sticking annoying ads between paragraphs.

I love that this new Kindle has a bigger flush screen that goes closer to the edges. I can read in the pool with one hand in extremely bright sunlight without any worries or eye strain. At night I can switch it ti dark mode where it's white text on black background and puts off very little light to disturb my wife if I'm up late finishing a chapter. It's got a USB-C port, which I like better because my only problem with older Kindles is when the USB Micro port would start to get loose. Not sure if that would surely would be improved by this, but the fact that USB-C is reversible might make the difference. Plus I think it charges faster and that's one less cable to pack. The new adjustable color temperature setting is a feature I didn't think I'd care about but it's actually nice. If I do some low-light reading with warmth on 3-4, then switch it back, the screen looks all blue and harsh. This think is pleasant to read no matter how dark or bright it is. Finally, it feels like there's still more performance improvements to this one. It feels faster when I turn the page or scroll through my books.

I can tell there's one corner of the screen that's just a bit yellowish even when the settings are for 0 warmth. Lots of people have complained about even screen lighting in all the different Kindle Paperwhites. It's probably the hardest thing to engineer, and this is not an expensive device. What I find is that if the book I'm reading is good, I don't notice it at all.

Amazon should do a subscription plan where you commit to 24 months of Kindle Unlimited and get the Kindle PaperWhite included, and then trade up at the end. They'd still be selling the cases and upcharging for the higher models, but I think that would get more people reading a lot more and maybe draw even more authors to Kindle Unlimited.",5.0

Los libros los adquiría a un vendedor que me daba facilidades de crédito pero en la pandemia sufrió un revés económico y no pudo volver a vender a crédito. En Colombia donde vivo lo precios de los libros son demasiado altos por lo que la compra de libros ya no era tan regular si no esporádicamente. Había tratado de leer en mi Tablet y/o PC pero me cansaba demasiado. Hace unas semanas me encontré con una amiga que estaba leyendo en un Kindle y me mostro lo amigable y práctico que era la lectura en este dispositivo así que decidí comprarme mi propio Kindle. Estoy feliz y retome mi pasión por la lectura. Ya no me preocupa el tener que prestar libros pues simplemente los comparto con otros usuarios de Kindle sin preocuparme de si me los devuelven o no. El precios de los libros digitales en mucho más económico y se consiguen casi todas las obras clásicas gratis o a muy bajo precio en sitios legales. Sigo leyendo también en libro físico y si hay algún libro que me interesa conservarlo voy a la librería y lo compro. Puedes configurar tu Kindle a tus necesidades de lectura en cuanto a tamaño de letra, brillo de la pantalla, márgenes, color del ""papel"". La batería dura semanas y con el cargador original se recarga en unas pocas horas y lo mejor, puedes tener tu biblioteca portátil y llevarlo a todas partes.

I especially love the dark mode for reading in bed. I’m also really looking forward to using this on vacation, while in the pool or on the beach since it’s waterproof.

I only wish I had got one sooner!",5.0
3172,"I had a Fire tablet that was slow and the Kindle app just does not do dark mode on it. The Kindle Paperwhite, however, does dark mode! I can read at night til I fall asleep without headaches. Before I would try to read and couldn't stand the light for more than 20mins. Now I am bumbling around finding all sorts of books. This has also prevented me from watching TV until I fall asleep. Now I read to fall asleep. This is SO light. I love that I could take this anywhere. I love real books, the smell of pages w/ink and all but when you already have a million things to travel with, this just simplifies it.
Trade in your old Kindle/Fire tablet and get this one with Dark Mode and you'll find yourself reading more.",5.0
3173,"Obviously it's in a totally different class than the kindle fire - but for a reader-only it's great! I like the size - easy to hold, lightweight, etc. It is taking me a while to get used to the touch screen and all the components (ie. Touch right to advance, touch top for menu, swipe top down for settings, etc) the biggest thing I miss is the pretty color covers of the books and color maps and pictures in the books. So if you still want color don't get this reader. I do miss being able to zoom into MAPS in the books - I cannot see them that small. Overall I do like this reader, but miss my kindle fire also.",5.0

3178,"I recently purchased the Kindle Paperwhite and I have to say, I'm really enjoying it. As someone who loves to read, I was looking for an e-reader that would be easy on my eyes and would allow me to take my books with me wherever I go. The Paperwhite definitely fits the bill.

One of the things I love most about the Paperwhite is the screen. It's really easy on the eyes, even in low light, and the text looks super crisp and clear. I've also found that the Paperwhite is really lightweight and easy to hold, which is great for long reading sessions.

The Paperwhite also has a lot of great features that make it easy to customize your reading experience. You can change the text size and font, add highlights and notes, and even translate words on the fly. And with the built-in light, you can read anytime, anywhere.

Overall, I'm really happy with my purchase of the Kindle Paperwhite. It's a great e-reader that's easy on the eyes and has a lot of useful features. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone looking for an e-reader.",5.0
3179,"My hubby and I have been talking about getting kindles for a while now! We decided on the paper white because of the size and lighting options. In my opinion, the ads aren’t worth spending $20 to get rid of. The first picture is where they are, only on the Lock Screen! It’s a great size to hold with one hand and navigate to read. We have a new baby so it makes holding him and reading so easy! Definitely will be getting a case for it soon because the back of it easily shows grime from the hands and what not but that’s expected. DO IT!! (Also got the kindle unlimited promo for $.99 / 3 months)",5.0

3183,"I’ve been a kindle user since they were first released back in the day. Ive probably owned about four kindles including a kindle fire over the years. This kindle version is a great. I like how easy it is to navigate around the settings. A lot of the good user experience does have to do with the operating system upgrades (which I had on my old kindle too) but I still feel like the reading experience is smoother. The ability to adjust the background lighting is a game changer, I like my background soft and warm, less strain on my eyes. Overall no huge changes from what I can tell but still an improved experience. No need to spend extra for more storage or the other bells and whistles, this version should suit most enthusiastic readers just fine.",5.0
3184,"I bought this after some research, I initially was interested because I was looking to read more but tend to approach all physical books as non-fiction/reference material. I started reading and watching reviews on the Kindle and I'll lay out here what pushed me over the line to purchase this;

You can add Articles with a two button shortcut from your desk top.

This means I can spend my day just tabling every article and piece of reading just hitting ALT + K then closing the site this has done two things eliminated the amount of ""good Will"" eventually I'll read it tabs on my browser!

Secondly I now put down my phone at the end of the night and pick up the kindle, no chances of getting distracted by doom scrolling, just article after article and book after book.

It's helped with insomnia a great amount! I'm not saying that buying this cured my insomnia what I'm saying is last night I couldn't sleep until 6am and because of the kindle I was up all night reading American Gods and NOT Doom Scrolling or trying to fight off negative thoughts or emotions, Yeah I still get fatigue and yeah I still lose sleep, but I since I've gotten this I haven't had one of those moments where I'm like, ""One day the sun will explode..."" and now I'm UP UP UP UP UP!",5.0
3185,"I have always been more of a physical book person over e-readers - they tend to hurt my eyes and need charging, etc. etc. but I have definitely 'seen the light' and converted to a lover of the Kindle paper white. It's super light weight and easy to take in my purse to get my nails done, wait at the doctor's office, etc. and I'm reading so much more because of it. I do recommend a case as the screen scratches pretty easily, especially if putting it in various bags/purses versus just sitting on your nightstand or around your house. There are a lot of features to adjust to the perfect reading light and brightness/warmth, and I love being able to read at night without an overhead light or lamp on.",5.0

3190,"After eight years my iPad had seen better days. For the past few years, I had only been using it to read e-books, and spending the money for a new one didn't make sense. I decided to try out a Kindle because I had been using the app on my iPhone and iPad and didn't have any problems. I was concerned after reading a few reviews that I wouldn't be able to borrow books through Libby on this device. Don't let the negative reviews scare you away-it's very easy to get books from Libby onto this device!
It does come with the charging cable, but not the adapter to plug it into the wall. However, chances are you already have a USB wall adapter. You can also charge it via your laptop or desktop if for some reason you don't have a USB adapter.
I did find that was a little awkward to hold, but a Popscocket fixed that problem!",5.0

3192,"I have read hundreds of books on Kindle since its inception and in retirement am reading even more. This is my fifth one -- the 11th Gen. I am still new to it and will edit this if further excerience with it suggests I've overlooked anything in this review. My main coments are:
(i) It is annoying that the plug-in power wire head (where is goes into the Kindle) is diffferent from the 10th Gen plug-in head. They are incompatible. This means more wires at hiome if you are keeping and still using a 10th Gen as I do. (Same had to be said for failure in 10th Gen to copy plug-in head format for Apple iPhones so that both could be used with one wire.)
(ii) The new screen is significantly larger, a nice feature, but one has lost non-screen device margin for fingers to hold the device while reading. One-handed Kindle holding for reading was never easy, but it's now mpossible.
(iii) The new ""Warmth Schedule"" feature in Device Options works well and surely will be set",5.0

3201,"First and foremost, the 6.8"" display is simply stunning. It's larger than the previous generation of Kindle Paperwhite and the difference is noticeable. The high-resolution display makes reading enjoyable and effortless, with crisp text and clear images that are easy on the eyes. The larger display size means that there's more space for text, which reduces the need to frequently turn pages.

The adjustable warm light is another feature that I love about the Kindle Paperwhite. It's perfect for nighttime reading and makes reading before bed more comfortable. The warm light is easy on the eyes and creates a relaxing ambiance that helps to promote sleep. The adjustable feature means that I can customize the warmth and brightness of the light to my liking, which is great for creating a personalized reading experience.

In addition to its impressive display and warm light, the Kindle Paperwhite is also waterproof, making it ideal for use by the pool, at the beach, or in the bathtub. It's lightweight and portable, making it easy to take anywhere, and its long battery life means that I can read for weeks without needing to recharge.

The Kindle Paperwhite also comes with a vast selection of books, magazines, and newspapers, making it an excellent choice for avid readers. With its easy-to-use interface and intuitive navigation, it's effortless to find and download the books I want to read.

Overall, the Kindle Paperwhite is an exceptional e-reader that provides an enjoyable and comfortable reading experience. With its beautiful 6.8"" display and adjustable warm light, it's perfect for those who love to read at night or in low light environments. If you're in the market for an e-reader, the Kindle Paperwhite is definitely worth considering!",5.0

3212,"I bought this Kindle as an emergency replacement for my wife when her Kobo stopped being able to access Overdrive. That turned out to be a temporary outage of the service and it's back in business.

So, what to do with this Kindle? Easy, it's my Kindle now!

I hadn't joined the ebook bandwagon yet, but I figured since it's here, I'll give it a go.

And I...don't see myself ever buying a physical copy of a book again. As sad as that sounds, I just have zero desire. These Kindles are incredible. I don't ever intend to shop on the Kindle itself. It's just not ideal. It'll work in a pinch if you're out and about I guess, but even then I'd opt to use my phone.

That said, you buy a kindle book on Amazon, and voila it shows up on your Kindle.

It's the ease of use though that really takes the cake. The battery lasts, I don't know, 24 years apparently. Or at least that's what it feels like. e ink is downright incredible in this aspect. Some people might be hesitant about looking at a display, but this is by FAR my favorite aspect of this device. Every book I buy. Every last one? Appears identical on the screen. You ever get a book that has super tiny text? Or bad printing? Or a really annoying serif that makes it difficult to read? Yeah, not here pal. It all looks perfect. And with the backlight off, it looks no different than looking at a page out of a book. This is easily one of the most impressive displays I've seen in the last decade. You can keep your 4k ultra blah blah, this is a display that appears every bit like it's literal paper. Insane.

And there's perks to be had for miles! Bookmarks? Ha, forget 'em! Thing of the past. Reading a book by an author who wants to impress you with his million-dollar words? Click the word, it pops up with a definition. Unbelievably handy, especially for foreign words. It'll tell you how many minutes it's going to take you to finish the chapter. I'm tellin ya, there's no going back.

And then there's Libby. If you've got a decent library like we do, there are oodles of books available to rent as a Kindle version. Easy as that. Click borrow.

The backlight is fantastic, has the orange LEDs so it's a nice warm color.

I have nothing else to say. It's basically perfect in every way.

Unfortunately, I ordered the case intended for the wife.

It took me a bit to figure out all the settings and I think I am still learning, but its been great fun. Before I got my cover for it, I had to turn it off and on manually. The screen would pop right up. Now with the cover it puts it to sleep when I close it, and turns it on immediately when I open the cover. Such a difference from my old one! And the screen is so much brighter and crisper and clearer. It’s such a pleasure to read from it!",5.0

So I thought I'd give the Paperwhite 2021 a whirl. I didn't expect the Paperwhite to be this good, but it is. I LOVE it! One, it is slight, iighter, easier to hold, less clunky. I don't go anywhere without my Kindle. The Paperwhite 2021 is easier to cart around. Two, who needs those Oasis page-turner buttons when a quick and slight tap on the screen does the job? Three, the display is larger than the earlier Paperwhites. Though not as large as the Oasis, its almost as large and, in my opinion, quite perfect and better than earlier Paperwhites. Four, the adjustable warm light is very nice. The newest 2021 Oasis also has this feature but.....the price for the new Paperwhite is lower. Now, I'm not sure how long a charge will last because it arrived just yesterday. I'll update my review when I figure that out. (I do use Airplane mode to protect the charge).

The customer service was awesome and sent me a replacement. (Knock on wood) I haven’t had any issues with this new one and it’s July now.
Overall, I love this thing, especially with a KU subscription. It makes it easy to read, anywhere, at any time of day. I’m pretty sure this is supposed to have up to 10 weeks of battery life, mine only lasts about 2-3 weeks if I’m reading exclusively on my kindle for long periods of time. This doesn’t really bother me, but the 10 weeks sounds more like a standby charge and not a use charge.
I love that it’s got the option to make the screen tone an orange hue, which is ideal for night time reading. It’s also waterproof so I don’t have to worry about it getting wet if I’m reading while taking a relaxing bath or lounging by the pool.

I would get frustrated with my old one at how slow it loaded and how many times I had to tap on something before it registered that I was touching the screen. The color is easier on your eyes while reading too. It is a little pricey, but overall all definitely worth the upgrade.

3262,"This is my 2nd Paperwhite Kindle and the one I liked the least because of its overly sensitive touch screen. Because the screen no longer have this ""frame"" it's way too easy for a finger to slightly touch the reading area causing a page turn or the menu to drop-down. I tried to use narrower margins to no avail. I ended up returning it. Hopefully the next version won't have this issue.",1.0
3263,"Coming from a seven year old Paperwhite 3, I found this to be a a really nice upgrade. It has a high quality, premium feel and bigger, brighter display while keeping with the nice small size form factor. The adjustable display is easy to look at for long periods and the menu functions are very intuitive. The display features are just as intuitive with finger swiping to change font size and I like the quick access to dark mode and/or the warmer color back light. I didn't notice how much of a cool bluish light my old Paperwhite gave off until I compared it to this one. I much prefer the warmer setting and dark mode for night reading. I didn't have any issues of glare while reading in the daylight. I liked the page turn feature but I didn't notice it working in dark mode which is fine since overall the pages turn faster and the dark mode screen doesn't flash and I keep page refresh off. The screen does refresh sometimes when navigating menus or the library and is a bit laggy like my older Paperwhite but OK. The no-ad version is a must for me and I like the option of displaying the nice random graphics or a book cover when the Kindle is turned off. I like that it's waterproof for peace of mind. I found it easy to download all my ebooks from my Kindle account webpage. I had to select all to do it in bulk. I now have all my entire library available for offline reading. I keep my Kindle in airplane mode to save battery. As far as physical ergonomics while reading, overall this is very comfortable to hold, lightweight and smooth to the touch. I prefer to hold my Kindle without any attached covers but the only very minor annoyance I have is that while holding it from the bottom edge, if my fingers might touch the charging port or on/off button I feel a slightly irritating and uncomfortable sharp sensation against my skin so I can't support the Kindle from the middle without sometimes resting my fingers against those irritating edges. Finally, I like the battery life and fast charging speed. Happy with my purchase. My old Paperwhite still works fine and is a very good reader worth keeping handy in a separate room.",1.0

3267,"My three year old kindle broke, and I got this to replace it. I wasn't expecting it to be noticeably different, since the one I was replacing wasn't that old. And, in most respects, the experience should be the same... a slightly bigger screen, adjustable warmth on the reading light, not exactly a giant remodel.... and yet, it feels noticeably better. More comfortable to read. I guess all the small improvements have a big impact? I've always felt like the kindle was less good than a real book (but the space and money savings were worth it, because I read a lot). I actually really LIKE this one.

One thing to note: the last two times I bought a kindle, I went the cheap route and got the one with the ads. This time I decided to splurge on the no-ad version. I feel like an idiot for not doing that before. It is a small thing, but I think it makes a big difference!",1.0

3279,"When my old Kindle gave up the ghost, I traded it in for this one. Navigating the interface is less than intuitive, and the fact that I purchased 3 new kindle books only to find out after purchasing them that two of them are ""Incompatible"" with my new Kindle has me a little miffed. Sure, I can read them on my Android phone, but I specifically bought a new Kindle so I wouldn't *HAVE* to use my phone. Since I run Linux on all my computers, and Amazon doesn't provide a Linux Reader App (Android *IS* Linux, btw, and for that matter the Kindle runs a version of Linux), I have no other choice. It would be nice if Amazon put the compatible devices link at the TOP of the page, rather than at the bottom where it took me an hour to find it and figure it out since there are no warnings to check device compatibility before making a purchase(I had to find out by accident). Be forewarned, if you even *find* the link on a particular book title, it probably WON'T open on this technological wart.
Looking over the books I *WAS* planning on buying in the near future, I find that 2/3 of them are ""incompatible"" with this Gen 11 Kindle paperwhite. I suppose it's OK if all you read is Romance Novels, but if you're interested in something more substantial, It would be better to buy a cheap Android Tablet for $50 and use the E-Reader App. As for this, I think I'll just do a Factory Reboot on it, and sell it on e-Bay.",1.0

Anyway, I received my new Kindle yesterday and I couldn’t be happier. It’s absolutely perfect! The size, the white screen, the back light; it’s all perfect.

3286,"I forgot how much I missed a regular Kindle. The last kindle I had was the Kindle fire, so it has been several years. This is much easier on the eyes than the Kindle fire, the Nook color, or the iPad. And reading on the iPad or the Kindle fire, I found I was always interrupted with a text, or an email, or a phone call when it was linked to my phone. I had initially liked the idea of a tablet that had everything in one place, but it does interfere with reading, I find. I am really liking the Kindle, as just a device for reading. It’s also less (or maybe no?) blue light, and I read before bed, so not using a tablet/computer may help or be better for sleep. It is very light weight, and the suggestions/adds on the lock screen don’t bother me. Page turning is easy, but it is sometimes “tricky” to get into and out of other menus. It takes a little getting used to, as the response is different than other touchscreens, in my opinion. It takes a while to find your ideal brightness and warmth settings (I like about 16-18 brightness and no warmth during the day. I set it to shift to warmer in the evening/early morning). Just be aware, if you are used to reading on a tablet, you will lose the color images on the Paperwhite. No big deal, unless you read a lot of cookbooks, graphic novels, or other animated content. Still, if you have the Kindle app on another tablet or computer, it’s easy to switch between the two, if you want. It came 50% charged. I bought the charging plug too. Like many people state, it should really just come with the plug, but most things don’t now, so I don’t really hold that against Amazon in this case. I’ve always been afraid of using “off-brand,” discount plugs/cables; so, I figured why not just buy a new one. I’ve also turned off WiFi to save battery: that’s not just a toggle on/off, either. You just have to use the Airplane Mode to turn WiFi off/on. So far, so good, and I’m glad I made the purchase.",5.0

The font crispness is so much better and the page turning works easily. After customizing the lighting and font, it’s wonderful to use. Being water resistant is an added bonus. It does appear heavier than my old one, but I’ll put up with that because of the other improvements. I didn’t really want the ads, but have found they are no big deal. It’s just a display when you wake the kindle, of the cover of a book you might like, and goes away when you swipe to open your content. Not worth $20 to do away with, in my opinion.

I didn’t realize that the blue light on my iPad and iPhone could be what was making it difficult for me to stay focused on digital books. I bought this kindle paperwhite to see if I could really read at night without problem. The first week I stayed up until 2am reading. I felt young again. It doesn’t make my eyes tired and the ability to read in the dark and adjust the size of the text is life changing. I’ve read 5 books this month and probably read less than that all of last year.

3296,"I guess I just expect more. I had to edit this review after looking at my ""Goodreads"" account. Goodreads tracks the books that you've read on your Kindle. Since March of 2020 I have read 290 books. Accept for professional ""reviewers"" or editors I guess that's an awful lot more than the average person has read.
And, while that doesn't seem overdone to me I imagine it would to many. However, the fact remains, the battery life is not nearly as long as Amazon would have you believe, 10 weeks, that is such a wrong statement, unless you only read for 15 - 30 minutes a day, then perhaps it will last that long though I doubt it. If you're an avid reader be prepared to plug it in at least every other day. The response time, for page turning, or anything is slow. The last 2 updates are trash and make the Kindle Table of Contents even slower, The Table of Contents is bulky and unwieldy. Seriously, it's easier and better to look at book covers as opposed to just the title??? As for a color Kindle - again, seriously are your books in color? Why does the Kindle need something else to go wrong? Intuitive - no way are these updates intuitive, response time is slowed to unbelievable levels. I've lost track of how many times I've had to restart my Kindle, It's a year and a half old. Yes, I do read a lot, between 2 - 3 hours per day. My kindle has to be charged every 3 - 4 days at the most. There used to be a Kindle ""forum"". Doesn't exist any longer - too many complaints I believe. Now you will get no response from Amazon (except lip service - - - maybe) no matter what your comment. I use a Kindle because I ""need"" to read, I have issues with my hands and can not hold a hardcover book - - hence I 'm sorry to say I depend on the Kindle. In one of the reviews, the reviewer had some similar complaints. The reviewer also said he received a ""call"" from the developer??!?

3307,"Kindle Paperwhites don't get updated very often, and each of the previous two models (2015 and 2018) have been only SLIGHTLY improved from their predecessors. This has been frustrating, because the underlying technology has improved, and I've felt the Kindle could be so much better. But Amazon has little competition in the e-ink e-reader market (the Kindle's market share is around 75%, the other 25% is all other brands combined), so Amazon has little incentive to pack the latest tech into their devices.

But the 2021 Paperwhite is a big leap forward, compared to the 2015 and 2018 models. The biggest improvement is the screen quality: sharp, dark text and the ability to adjust the warmth of the background makes it look much more like paper than ever before. This significantly improves the reading experience, and eye comfort.

Second is the size of the display, which is now 6.8"" diagonally compared to 6.0"" for previous models, which makes it taller and wider. The difference between the new & old screen size is similar to the difference between a trade paperback (which is nearly the size of the hardcover version, without the hard cover) and a mass market paperback (which is significantly smaller than the hardcover version, with pages that are more cramped with text).

Third is the size of the bezels around the display. The bezels on the 2018 and earlier models look very chunky compared to the narrower bezels on the 2021 model, which are narrower yet still big enough that you can hold the Paperwhite without your fingers blocking the screen. This change is cosmetic, and some people won't care about it. But many people like the narrower bezels, and also it means that more of the device is screen so you're getting a bigger ratio of screen to overall size & weight.

Speaking of that, the 2021 model is slightly bigger and very slightly heavier than the 2018 model. I compared them side-by-side, and the differences were apparent. But after using the new model for 15 minutes, I didn't care and haven't given it a thought since.

I've now had my 2021 Paperwhite for 5 weeks and I've read 4 books on it. I've definitely had a better experience with it than any previous Paperwhite model I've owned. Even my wife, who normally has zero interest in updating her tech unless her old model stops working, ordered a 2021 Paperwhite once she saw how much better mine is compared to the previous gen Paperwhites we both have been using for years.

When we bought ours, Amazon gave us each $28 in trade-in credit for our previous Paperwhites plus a $25 discount, so the net cost was around $90 + tax each. Not bad! Though if I had to pay full price, I happily would, knowing how much better the 2021 Paperwhite is.

One last thing: don't buy Amazon's leather cover for this new Paperwhite. It's a big step down from the leather covers for the 2015 & 2018 models. Read the user reviews, most people really dislike it. On the other hand, Amazon's fabric cover is very nice, and there are third-party covers that are good to great and cost less than Amazon's own covers.

3317,"I like books but don't really have a place to store a lot of them so the concept of an e-reader capable of holding hundreds n hundreds of books in nearly no space is very attractive. Lately cooking has been my thing, specifically with my crockpot express cooker. First download was the several crockpot express cookbooks on amazon. I'm also into natural healing and a couple of those books came second. The e-reader is a basic tablet and kindles have water resistance features to protect against spills drops, rain etc. For that reason I'm not afraid to use it in the kitchen where anything can happen. While the screen on the kindle is designed to accept your finger as a stylus I find that one of the old style rubber tipped stylus actually works better than a finger most of the time. These devices are not designed with speed demon processors they are designed for long battery life, a readable screen and massive storage in a small space and they do that well. My only ""wish"" might be a more functional note pad that would allow notes on individual pages to be stored along with the book file. When I cook I sometimes experiment with ingredients and if I want to alter a recipe I have to copy it out to msnotes or something along those lines to keep notes. I keep my kindle sitting on the computer desk most of the time and I usually get several weeks of battery life easily and that's pretty good. It uses the same charger as my year old cell phone usb c ppp and charges fast from a 40w charger but will also use lesser chargers as well. I like being able to search for text, especially with the cookbooks this is handy. You can bookmark pages you want to go back to.

3320,"Reduced to one star for review manipulation by Amazon. No reason given. Garbage reviews now dominate the top slot. This is a comprehensive and thorough review, which had the top spot for months on end. And then they just decided to hide it for no reason at all.

Summary:

+ Best screen of any Paperwhite or Kindle released to date
+ Best response time of any Paperwhite or Kindle
+ UI improvements
+ Weight and feel are exceptional
+ Flipping through library much improved after updates

- Screen has uneven area with color temp on high brightness
- Previous Kindles still do things in much the same way

Coming from the 7th gen Kindle, this is a gigantic improvement on all fronts. The Paperwhite 2021 also handily beats the pulp out of the Paperwhite 2018 version due to its new LED array, and for my money it's a better choice than the Oasis 3 as well due to ergonomics. Add in some extra screen real estate compared to previous Paperwhites, a much nicer bezel, a few more options for the UI, and what we have is an extremely polished device for reading digital books. It's never going to make me switch totally from physical, but I will definitely be using this to read a lot more than my previous Kindle.

The screen here is nearly perfect, and it will be the main factor attracting those coming from the previous 2018 model. If things were cheaper, this would be an essential upgrade for most people. I would not do without it if given the choice. Feel free to browse all the negative reviews from 2018. They were all right. But now it seems Amazon has finally finished their beta device. The screen itself is more matte than shiny, easy to wipe off, clear but not distracting, and fully able to replicate a physical book with its expanded dimensions. The Oasis 3 for instance irritates me with its form factor. The Paperwhite 2018 has an ugly bezel as well. This is exactly what I wanted out of an E-Reader.

The Paperwhite 2021 is lit by 17 LEDs compared to 5 LEDs in the 2018 model, which leads to vastly superior balance. There are 24 gradations for both brightness and warmth, from off to mango warm, and they make a tangible and visible difference in proper aesthetics related to actual physical books. The color options are great, but after some use there still seems to be a portion equating to about the bottom half of the screen on mine that is a very slightly greener hue as opposed to a warmer hue on top. Very hard to pick up for some people, but it's worth noting for users that want to use this on high brightness. I usually only use around 6-12 brightness to get proper coloring, and it's not really noticeable in lit rooms with these settings. I usually use the lovely dark mode at night, so in the end I'll say this issue really doesn't affect me much.

Make no mistake, though, the 2018 Paperwhite had an awful screen, with a horrendous LED array, and this one is a massive upgrade. This 2021 version still has a fully stable lighting array that doesn't evoke a poor production run or haste in design, yet it's not perfect either. Blacks could definitely be deeper with an OLED screen or something of the sort. Dark Mode still looks good, but on higher brightness it appears a little too grey. Overall, I am satisfied at the advances that have been made, and my usual settings all look fantastic and so much better than anything before.

6.8 inches of screen along with 300 PPI is definitely enough to satisfy most demands for resolution, and the extra space may be convincing for one to switch from physical books. The bezel itself also looks properly designed finally. That alone is also another huge deal. The sides are thin, the screen is the main attraction, and there is no awkwardness in reading versus a real book. All additions that make this is a positive buy over the other Kindles.

There is an extremely tiny trail of adhesive in one corner and edge at the very bottom right near the backing material and black area of the bezel. Pretty minor all told. Most won't even notice things like this, and most Kindles will probably have such a minor flaw. Compared to the 2018 version, this thing seems like an actual professional product.

The UI responsiveness was another issue in previous models, and I am happy to report this one is very fast. Massively faster than my 7th gen, and a decent improvement over the older model. The Paperwhite 2018 uses a Freescale/NXP i.MX6 SoloLite 1 GHz processor. Not terrible, but also not quite enough to match the newer NXP i.MX7D 1 GHz chip used in the Oasis 3 and this model. Again, a more refined version at every level compared to the older Paperwhite.

For memory and storage, I can't see many people needing more than 8GB. I did fine on my last Kindle with much less. Unless you plan on starting a small library, 8GB of memory is a perfect fit for anyone's lifetime.

As for the user interface, major changes have resulted in a much better flow in overall design for most Kindles from 2015 onward. The swipe down mechanic is leagues better than anything they've had before. The library UI that you tap in the upper left is again fast and finally consistent. These UI details are easy to spot in the included pictures with various lighting values. But they are available to most users outside of this Kindle.

Appending this review with the latest firmware update as of December 2022, and Amazon has finally listened to people about library navigation: you can scroll a vertical wheel on the right side with 6 entries per page. It's unimaginably better than it was before this. Thank you for listening.

Response and animation are a cut above their predecessors, and that should not be understated. I finally feel the Kindle is quick enough for my needs with digital reading. My 7th gen was abysmal. The 2018 version was slightly problematic. The newer page turn animation, however, was not to my liking, and I ended up sticking with the normal style. As a plus, the web browser is snappy and usable for those that need to quickly look something up on a search engine. Exiting in and out of menus is a breeze, and opening or downloading books was efficient. I still wish there was a download all option, so I will be downloading from the website instead.

And speaking of default, the designers have made sure that this Kindle is ready to use without even touching a setting. They clearly invested a lot in understanding how people want their Kindle to look. I found almost all default options to be optimal. I added one step to boldness in fonts, and have toyed with the variable warmth quite a bit. Bookerly is a great font for reading, but there are obviously other options if you prefer. These things are basically as good as they need to be on this digital reader. More improvements with font selection could be possible, but are entirely superfluous to the current experience.

Updating the firmware was painless for me past having to click no thanks for all the subscriptions Amazon wants to get you hooked on. No thanks. No issues with connections or anything of the sort. Charging works perfectly via USB-C, a far better connector than the micro version. Adding and subtracting to the library was fast and convenient.

Aesthetics and materials are premium for the most part. Other than the aforementioned pinprick trail of adhesive, there were no outright imperfections that I can see. I don't really like the Oasis 3, but it's definitely similar to that version, with a better form factor.

The leather case included with this bundle is what it is: completely overpriced but nearly mandatory for the perfect feel and weight. I can't stand the feel of the device without the included case. I highly recommend the bundle. The aesthetics look nice, and overall it's mostly the same as my last one. A bit easier to get in and out compared to 7th gen.

Battery life seems improved. I wouldn't call it all that great on full brightness, but it's definitely an upgrade from anything before. Battery life is critical, yet I have run into few issues with my normal settings. Right now, I can see that it drains decently fast on max brightness, but it also has an array of 17 LEDs lighting it. On lower brightness, it appears to be very conservative with battery life, much the same as last time but probably better. It's tough to say when you are comparing older batteries to newer ones. This will be an ongoing process to be updated in the review every now and then. On the lowest brightness it is off of course, for those that prefer the older Kindle experience and extended usage without a charge. This obviously produces a charge that lasts a very long time. With hibernation, I have no issues with battery life, but it's only a few months old.

Stemming from that thought, I see no reason to keep Wi-Fi on, and the complaints about that particular setting, coming from 2018, seem slightly obtuse. Shut it off when your library is downloaded. Problem solved. With full brightness, you aren't going to get a ton of life, but I also recommend against full brightness as it doesn't really resemble paper at that point. On medium settings, which I prefer, battery life seems completely acceptable and better than before.

If you are currently using a device below the Paperwhite 2018, then definitely you could think about an upgrade if you are in the market for a new E-Reader. I cannot overstate how much better this is than my 7th gen. I rarely even used that model, and I will definitely be clocking in some time with this one due to the screen and response time. It's a huge motivating factor to actually take out my Kindle now. Previous versions do not match up, and this is the first time I can say I am impressed by a Kindle.

The screen is too versatile to pass up, and the faster response time basically nails the previous version in its coffin. I don't think an immediate upgrade is necessary, but most will want this as their baseline going forward. The 2018 version has too many issues, and this fixes most of them.

Economically, this might not be an option for many. To somewhat help out, you definitely will want to get this in the bundle with the leather case, which I included a picture of at the bottom. It's a nice case, way too expensive by itself, and kind of mandatory in my experience. The bundle also includes a trade-in option.

Outside of that you can be sure I will remain critical of this device. If anything goes wrong, becomes damaged or defective, I will immediately add that info to my review. Freezes have gone completely away as of the recent firmware update in 1.14.1.1.

For those on the fence, it is best to wait a few months to see how things turn out. For now, I enjoy the device and have only a few issues. Going forward I hope to actually use a Kindle consistently for the first time. If I rated the Paperwhite 2018 one star, then this one is around four stars. A worthy upgrade for anybody in the market. Will it replace my physical collection? Never. Paper lives on forever.

3327,"2/7/23 Update R*diculous
Well, I not longer own any Kindle books. They have reformed all their books so that you must use their latest PC program only. You can read your books on your rented Kindle as long as the device works. If it fails, you must rent another one. So, for all intents and purposes, you may only rent devices and books from Amazon. Since the Kindle will not read EPUP documents and Amazon does not support their former formats, I would recommend finding another device that is easier to use, easier to back up and cheaper to replace one the rental period is ""over.""
It was great while it lasted.

Well I still cannot readily find a book on my Kindle. They have never fixed the software to resolve converting the great Kindle book with pages into a a scroll screen where you cannot find your content. I guess they think we all want to merely use it as if it were a phone where you scroll forever and cannot find your book.
Once I finally find the book I want, I do like reading the kindle. It just too bad they destroyed the user interface and no longer support their products as they originally did.

Update, They just updated my new Kindle so that it no longer works well at all
Did away with pages and went to a screen of unknowable length with no way to navigate.
The scroll bar is a joke with no control, so you must move one item at a time.
Why do the software people hate them now?

Called for support again. She was much better than the last but after over 20 minutes experimenting, the nice lady said the system had changed so much that the old options are no longer available. All she could do was return the setup to where it was marginally working and not user friendly.
She claimed Amazon monitored and cared, but their actions indicate otherwise.
The original Kindles were so great.
Why do the software people hate them now?
We are so frustrated that we cannot categorize and find the books that are on the kindle.
When I sought help, they told me I had to search on my PC or phone, but that doesn't help find what's on the kindle. When I said that was r*diculous, they said they didn't like that word.
Go back to pages rather than one screen you cannot scroll through.
Consider going to another device if you want usability.

3329,"I upgraded to this Kindle Paperwhite from an older, smaller Paperwhite. This newer model is so much better! It’s much more clear and crisp, the touch screen doesn’t lag as much, and I love that the screen is bigger! I pay the $10/mo for kindle unlimited as I’m always reading something and love that it has endless options of books to choose from. I’ve only had this since Christmas so I can’t really comment on the battery life, but I will say that so far, I’ve only had to charge it once from out of the box and I still have 86% battery life left. This is with reading for at least an hour a day the last two weeks. I also love that I can adjust the brightness and the warmth of the screen to my liking and what works for my eyes depending on what time of day I’m reading. If you are looking for a great e-reader, this does the job. The one con I have is that the touch screen still lags a bit, but not as much as my older Paperwhite version. I also love how the book cover pictures are clear and easy to see as well! If you are looking to upgrade your kindle Paperwhite or just looking to buy one, get this one! You can’t go wrong, you’ll love it!",3.0
3330,"I moved from a 2nd Gen Oasis to this be Paperwhite. I have no regrets. This is a great improvement to me. My Oasis didn't have warm light and I didn't think a lot about it until I got my hands on this. Wow what a difference it makes! So much better for my nighttime reading habit. It's also got the same screen resolution, but with a matching smaller screen. The difference in screen size is not noticable to me. The performance of the PaperWhite is better than that of my older Oasis, though both work great. I think the 16GB is a nice sweet spot for storage size for an eReader. 8GB gets a little tight if you want to toss an audiobook on there. I though I would miss page turn buttons but now that I think about it, I am only ever used them to turn the page back if necessary, which isn't very often, so it turns out I don't miss them at all.
